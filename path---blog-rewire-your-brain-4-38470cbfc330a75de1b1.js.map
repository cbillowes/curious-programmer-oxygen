I started interrogating this belief and realized\\nthat it stems from childhood where my parents told me how other people are\\nstarving in this world so I must finish my food.</p>\\n<p>This was causing me to overeat especially if I did not dish up for myself.\\nI decided to change the rule. If I didn't dish up myself, I will not\\nforce myself to finish the plate of food.</p>\\n<p>So watch out for these, often subtle, childhood survival rules, and decide\\nif it still applies to you in you current day. Maybe it's something small or\\nmaybe the behavior is actually self-destructive or causing self-harm.</p>\\n<p>These behaviors will be controlled by the automatic part of your brain so\\nyou may not be consciously aware of it. When you are, you can start to\\nactively work on it by rewiring you brain into a new habit or replacement\\nbehavior to break the feedback loop.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"change\\\"><a href=\\\"#change\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Change</h2>\\n<h3 id=\\\"1-identify-it\\\"><a href=\\\"#1-identify-it\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>1.

I started interrogating this belief and realized\\nthat it stems from childhood where my parents told me how other people are\\nstarving in this world so I must finish my food.</p>\\n<p>This was causing me to overeat especially if I did not dish up for myself.\\nI decided to change the rule. If I didn't dish up myself, I will not\\nforce myself to finish the plate of food.</p>\\n<p>So watch out for these, often subtle, childhood survival rules, and decide\\nif it still applies to you in you current day. Maybe it's something small or\\nmaybe the behavior is actually self-destructive or causing self-harm.</p>\\n<p>These behaviors will be controlled by the automatic part of your brain so\\nyou may not be consciously aware of it. When you are, you can start to\\nactively work on it by rewiring you brain into a new habit or replacement\\nbehavior to break the feedback loop.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"change\\\"><a href=\\\"#change\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Change</h2>\\n<h3 id=\\\"1-identify-it\\\"><a href=\\\"#1-identify-it\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>1.
