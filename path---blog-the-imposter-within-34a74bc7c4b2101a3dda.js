My inner\nimposter was once again "shining" and I was left feeling inadequate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes\nwondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.\n― Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Imposter syndrome <sup id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-1-ref">1</a></sup> is getting\na lot of attention within our community probably because research\n<sup id="footnote-2"><a href="#footnote-2-ref">2</a></sup> has estimated that 70% of the\ngeneral population has felt imposter tendencies in some part of their career.</p>\n<p>It\'s not a disease. It is a misshapen reality concocted by self-limiting beliefs\nand feelings of inadequacy. This reality remains solid even when information\nis presented that disproves it. The mind clings to the emotion rather than\nthe fact.</p>\n<p>In my research on this topic, a common underlying message stands out:\n<strong>nobody really knows what they\'re doing all the time</strong>. So the best anyone can\nreally do is to just try, fail, learn from it and try again.</p>\n<p>Logically I know this. Yet here I sit in my trough period trying to get out once\nagain. So <strong>instead of being hard on myself I am just accepting that right now\nit may seem bad, but this too shall pass</strong>.</p>\n<p>To help me progress, I can try to understand the compounding feelings that\ncontribute to this state of mind. By dissecting each one I may be able to make\nsmall adjustments to help me progress out of this:</p>\n<h2 id="self-doubt"><a href="#self-doubt" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Self-doubt</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\'d far rather be happy than right any day.\n― Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I\'ve been a software developer for a long time now. In my mind, I don\'t live up\nto my own expectations (which I have learned are exceptionally high for some\nreason). There is still so much I don\'t know, so much that I am uncertain of.</p>\n<p>How can you persuade someone to understand something if you have little\nconfidence in your own understanding? Doubt destroys confidence. Self-doubt\ndestroys confidence in yourself.</p>\n<p>Logically I know it\'s impossible to be certain of everything yet doubt\nlooms over me like a towering monster in the dark. I know that we simply have\nto figure things out as we go,\nremembering that it\'s okay to be wrong provided we learn from it. Some days\nare just better than others for me.</p>\n<p>There are many techniques <sup id="footnote-3"><a href="#footnote-3-ref">3</a></sup> to aid\nthose suffering with self-doubt such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember past successes and know that you had a role contributing to it.</li>\n<li>Talk to your peers about it. Chances are they are feeling the same.</li>\n<li>Keep a journal. Write down the good and bad and try to find a pattern.</li>\n<li>Don\'t beat yourself up.</li>\n<li>Don\'t compare yourself to others. It\'s unfair on yourself as you may have\ndifferent focus areas.</li>\n<li>Land an interview even if you\'re happy with your job.

I had no idea that things were\ngoing to turn out like this, so there was no way I could have planned things\nout. You just have to cope with what\'s happening, and deal with the next bit\nwhen it comes. ― Michael Marshall Smith, Only Forward</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Uncertainty (depending on the context) can sometimes make me very anxious.\nAt work, I don\'t like hearing myself say "I don\'t know".</p>\n<p>Yet this happens regularly. I don\'t know how long something is going to take to\nwork on, the impact it may have on the system or on the user, the complexity\nthat may creep in, the right people to talk to. I don\'t know because I don\'t\nhave all the facts. What I can do is figure it out as I go.</p>\n<p>The beauty of our industry (and life in general) is that there is still so much\nwe don\'t really know. No one knows everything no matter how fanatic people can\nbe in certain areas.</p>\n<p>There is no right way of doing something. There is always a better way. So we\nfigure things out. We put different pieces of the puzzle together. We\ntroubleshoot and fix things that are broken. We learn. We create.</p>\n<p>Some techniques <sup id="footnote-4"><a href="#footnote-4-ref">4</a></sup> we\ncan use in the face of uncertainty include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know that certainty is an illusion. Things can change in a heartbeat.</li>\n<li>Focus on what you can control.</li>\n<li>Get confident about your coping and adapting skills.</li>\n<li>Prepare for different possibilities.</li>\n<li>Accept constant imperfection.</li>\n<li>Don\'t get attached to everything. When it changes you tend to suffer.</li>\n<li>Reconnect with the constants in your life.</li>\n<li>Practice mindfulness.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ask yourself these three questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do I think is the worst possible realistic outcome of the situation?</li>\n<li>How will I feel about it?</li>\n<li>What will I do about it?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are water.
