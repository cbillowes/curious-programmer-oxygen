They become blind to learning better\nhabits, concepts, practices, and technologies through others.</p>\n<p>For years there have been <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/developer-ego">constant arguments</a>\nwithin the community regarding which languages, frameworks, tools, and\noperating systems are the best to use.</p>\n<p>Asking for help ends up in arguments with possible verbal abuse and belittling\nof skills and experience. StackOverflow is unfortunately an example of this.\nIt\'s notorious for\n<a href="https://sammaye.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/why-i-am-a-little-annoyed-with-stackoverflow-currently/">abusive commentary</a>.</p>\n<p>It discourages people from collaborating. Proposed solutions are shot down\nwithout constructive reasoning. Often the responses are "that\'s not how we\'ve\ndone things before" or "that\'s not what I prefer to do." These behaviors often\nnullifies the advantages of code reviews and pair/mob programming.</p>\n<p>These examples highlight some barriers that are created for communication,\ncollaboration and improvement. As software developers we are supposed to be\nrational thinkers but as human beings we are often driven by emotion.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, without some sense of self-esteem or self-importance,\nhow can we trust our own judgements and decisions?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The issue is not to break free of the ego, escaping it or transcending it.\nRather it is to learn how to harness the ego and transform it to use it in a\nway that serves us and helps us to create a life worth living.\n~ K.
