In biology, it means that organisms can change\nin its environment or different various habitats.</p>\n<p>Debbie Hampton defines it as the umbrella term referring to the ability of your\nbrain to reorganize itself, both physically and functionally, throughout your\nlife due to your environment, behavior, thinking, and emotions\n<sup id="footnote-2"><a href="#footnote-2-ref">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>She further shares her understanding by stating that the adult brain isn\'t a\nstatic or hard-wired organ. This means that you are not "stuck" with the\nbrain that you are born with <sup id="footnote-3"><a href="#footnote-3-ref">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>She mentions that it helps people recover from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A stroke, injury and birth abnormalities</li>\n<li>Improve symptoms of autism</li>\n<li>Improve ADD and ADHD</li>\n<li>Helps with learning disabilities and other brain defects</li>\n<li>Pull you out of depression and addictions</li>\n<li>Reverse obsessive-compulsive patterns</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Among other things, neuroplasticity means that emotions such as happiness\nand compassion can be cultivated in much the same way that a person can\nlearn through repetition to play golf and basketball or master a musical\ninstrument, and that such practice changes the activity and physical aspects\nof specific brain areas. ~ Andrew Weil, Spontaneous Healing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She has discovered the powers of it first-hand by performing her own home-grown,\nexperience-dependent neuroplasticity-based exercises for years to recover from\nher trauma.

For a more elaborate scientific list check out her article\n<strong>Ten Fundamentals Of Rewiring Your Brain</strong>\n<sup id="footnote-2"><a href="#footnote-2-ref">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be in the right frame of mind to make a change.</strong></p>\n<p>Your mood affects the brain release of neurochemicals. If you are in the\nright frame of mind then you would probably be actively engaged in what\nyou are doing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Focus intensely</strong></p>\n<p>By actively being engaged in what you are trying to master, you need to\nfocus intensely on what you are doing to help you experience a greater\nchange.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Practice.</strong></p>\n<p>The more you practice this change, moment by moment, in time, the more you\nstrengthen the connections of your neurons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Learning-driven changes.</strong></p>\n<p>Cell-to-cell cooperation is crucial for increased reliability. Learning-\ndriven changes increases this cooperation.</p>\n<p>Merzenich says that the more powerfully coordinated your nerve cells are,\nthe more powerful and more reliable their behavioral productions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create a conscious flow of behavior.</strong></p>\n<p>The brain strengthens its connections between teams of neurons\nrepresenting separate moments of successive things that reliably occur\nin serial time.</p>\n<p>This allows your brain to predict what happens next and have a continuous\n“associative flow” instead of a series of separate, stagnating events.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Initial changes are temporary.</strong></p>\n<p>Your brain experiences that change and decides if it must be permanent but\nit only does this if the experience is fascinating or novel enough.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mentally rehearse your change.</strong></p>\n<p>The brain is changed by internal mental rehearsal in the same ways and\ninvolving precisely the same processes that control changes achieved through\ninteractions with the external world.</p>\n<p>According to Merzenich, “You don’t have to move an inch to drive positive\nplastic change in your brain. Your internal representations of things\nrecalled from memory work just fine for progressive brain plasticity-based\nlearning.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Memory guides and controls most learning.</strong></p>\n<p>As you learn a new skill, your brain takes note of and remembers the good\nattempts, while discarding the not-so-good tries. Then, it recalls the last\ngood pass, makes incremental adjustments, and progressively improves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Take time to learn.</strong></p>\n<p>Every movement of learning provides a moment of opportunity for the brain to\nstabilize – and reduce the disruptive power of – potentially interfering\nbackgrounds or “noise.”</p>\n<p>Each time your brain strengthens a connection to advance your mastery of a\nskill, it also weakens other connections of neurons that weren’t used at\nthat precise moment.</p>\n<p>This negative plastic brain change erases some of the\nirrelevant or interfering activity in the brain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It can be healthy and unhealthy.</strong></p>\n<p>Brain plasticity is a two-way street; it is just as easy to generate\nnegative changes as it is positive ones.</p>\n<p>You have a “use it or lose it” brain. It’s almost as easy to drive changes\nthat impair memory and physical and mental abilities as it is to improve\nthese things.</p>\n<p>Merzenich says that older people are absolute masters at\nencouraging plastic brain change in the wrong direction.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pushing our self past our boundaries of limitation and extreme, sometimes to\nsomething that knocks off our comfort zone, it creates new neuro pathways\nwith our brain, we become smarter, wiser, more clarity, our life becomes\nmore fulfilling. Only because we have a totally new experience. We get a\nnew brain with that.
