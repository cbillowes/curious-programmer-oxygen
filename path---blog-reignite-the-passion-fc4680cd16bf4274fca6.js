We get frustrated when it\nfeels like mountains need to be moved to make even the smallest change.\nEventually people become disengaged by\n<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/yves_morieux_as_work_gets_more_complex_6_rules_to_simplify">complicatedness</a>\nand lose their passion they once felt for software development.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Rob Walling shared\n<a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com/2006/10/31/nine-things-developers-want-more-than-money/">nine things developers want more than money</a>.\nI completely agree with this ten years later:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Being set up to succeed</li>\n<li>Having excellent management</li>\n<li>Learning new things</li>\n<li>Exercising creativity and solving the right kind of problems</li>\n<li>Having a voice</li>\n<li>Being recognized for hard work</li>\n<li>Building something that matters</li>\n<li>Building software without an act of congress</li>\n<li>Having few legacy constraints</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Don\'t get me wrong. I don\'t want to work for free. I just value the quality of a\nworking environment and what I am working on more than the salary.\nOn the other spectrum, I hear of many people who put up with bad working\nconditions simply because of the money.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the reality is that there will always be some form of pain or\ntrade-off that we need to deal with. Prove to me that there is a <a href="blog/the-perfect-illusion/">company</a>\nto work for without any problems.</p>\n<p>Problems are different to each individual. We all have our own perspectives.\nThat means we are surrounded by people with different states or emotions\nwhether it be happy, comfortable, frustrated or completely disengaged.\nSadly it only takes one person with a sour mindset to bring an entire team\nto its knees.</p>\n<p>To top it off, there are so many different ways of achieving the same thing.\nEverything has risk attached to it. When people become driven by fear,\nthe need for change stagnates. It\'s also overwhelming when so many technologies\nemerge and we constantly feel like we have fallen behind.</p>\n<p>When we find ourselves in such predicaments, what can we do to avoid\nspiraling down the same rabbit hole?</p>\n<p><strong>Remember the day you wrote your first applications!</strong> That excitement you felt\nwhen you got your code to run even if it was just spaghetti. Bring that feeling\nback to the now and read on.</p>\n<p>Here are three things I\'ve done to help spread that feeling.</p>\n<h2 id="think-like-an-entrepreneur"><a href="#think-like-an-entrepreneur" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Think like an entrepreneur</h2>\n<p>I\'m not an entrepreneur. I\'ve been too scared to go down that path but I\'d like\nto someday.</p>\n<p>If I were one, I would need to make the best decisions to give me\nthe biggest return of investment in a short amount of time. I\'d have the user\'s\nbest interests at heart.

It\'s more code; more effort. There are deadlines.\nIf someone is coached to see the benefits and understand how easy it can be,\nwith time the mindset changes and confidence is built.</p>\n<p>In other words, people are used to doing things the way they feel comfortable\nwith. It\'s never a good idea to impose new ways of doing things on people.\nWe can gradually show how a technique can better productivity and\nreap more benefits.</p>\n<p>Grab opportunities to pair program with someone who is passionate and\npatient. If two people are just bickering about the smallest things pairing\nwon\'t achieve much. Empathy to a person\'s background and circumstances is\nimportant.</p>\n<h2 id="talk-to-the-right-people"><a href="#talk-to-the-right-people" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Talk to the right people</h2>\n<p>Many developers are introverts.

They will keep trying to\nfix it on their own.</p>\n<p>Building strong relationships is essential to solving problems quicker\nespecially when there are dependencies that are outside of your control.</p>\n<p>I encourage people to talk to the right people. This is a great way to\nacquire new knowledge about the people in the company, domain, infrastructure\nand technologies. If they don\'t know how, I do it with them.</p>\n<p>This builds confidence and exposes us to other people.

I never want to lose it - but\nI did.</p>\n<p>The transition from smaller companies to larger companies was tough on me.\nI got so caught up in my craft that I lost my confidence and the fun of\nactually writing code. I was also overwhelmed by everyone\'s opinions\nwhich often contradicted each other.</p>\n<p>When we work at corporates we are exposed to all sorts of people from all\nwalks of life. We aren\'t aware of their past experiences. People will lose\ntheir passion and find it again.</p>\n<p>I managed to pull through and reignite my passion thanks to many awesome\npeople I work with and some highly influential\ndevelopers like <a href="http://irisclasson.com/">Iris Classon</a> and <a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/">John Sonmez</a>.\nBy sharing my passion, I can see how it rubs off on others.</p>\n<p>Now, open your favorite editor or IDE and go write something that kicks ass.\nDon\'t forget to share your passion and what you learn with those around you!</p>',timeToRead:4,excerpt:"Do you remember how excited you were when you wrote your first program?
