I saw, listened and experienced my day like\nno other day before. I experienced a great day full of happy moments.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>What I achieved</th>\n<th>Because of</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>I worked sustainably</td>\n<td>I was focused</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I was stimulated</td>\n<td>I didn't multitask</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I heard what people had to say</td>\n<td>I actually listened</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I felt productive</td>\n<td>I was completing tasks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I had better posture</td>\n<td>I was mindful of my body</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I remembered more than usual</td>\n<td>I was consciously doing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I smiled meaningfully</td>\n<td>I was truly content</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Usually I'd be wrapped up in so many thoughts that I'd end up creating a clutter\naround me. I'd forget where I put things down.</p>\n<p>This clutter creates anxiety and I can rarely attend to it because I hardly\nhave enough time. When I do, I am too exhausted to care. This is physical\nevidence of the clutter going on in my mind.</p>\n<p>I struggle to finish tasks easily because <em>seemingly more important</em> ones\ncreep up and I'd run around - mentally and physically - multitasking which\nresults in feeling scatterbrained.</p>\n<p>As I was focused today, my mind was present. When I put something down, I put\nit down neatly. I didn't forget where I put it because I put it down\nconsciously. Both was a consequence of doing things with intent.</p>\n<p>When I got to work and sat at my table, in a few minutes my table was\neffortlessly clean and I had attended to more than I have ever been able to do\nin the past. <strong>Everything I did was done with intent and slower than usual.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I learned that it takes time to make time. Rushing to get everything done only\ncreates a mental clutter in my mind that impedes clarity and insight.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Doing things with intent in a focused manner naturally breaks me out of the\nsurvival-mode I am so accustomed to and frees me from multitasking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If I can't get to everything in a day, then so be it. Practicing being mindful\nhas aided me in approaching my day in a more sustainable way while living in\nthe here and now.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I felt like a got more out of my day (and time) because I was actually living\nin the moment instead of in the past or future.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This practice is very rewarding, sustainable, keeps me calm and makes me happy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are caught in the past or in the future. You are not there in the present\nmoment, living your life deeply. That is forgetfulness. The opposite of\nforgetfulness is mindfulness. ~ <a href=\"http://www.mindful.org/author/thich-nhat-hanh/\">Thich Nhat Hanh</a></p>\n</blockquote>",timeToRead:3,excerpt:"Everything I did today was done with intent and slower than usual.
