Identify the beliefs that support your intention</h3>\n<p>You need to believe that it is actually possible to change your behavior\nin a certain way. If you don\'t believe it is possible, you cannot change.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are your beliefs regarding the particular behavior?</li>\n<li>Identify the beliefs that make it possible to change your behavior.</li>\n<li>Make these beliefs your intention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: When someone is questioning Jane, she gets defensive because she\nfeels interrogated and makes her feel threatened. Those are her beliefs.</p>\n<p>She could identify that not all questions are interrogations and that she\ndoesn\'t have to feel threatened.</p>\n<p>She can use this to her advantage and as her intention to not get defensive\nthe next time she is questioned but she must believe it.</p>\n<h3 id="2-embrace-your-strong-positives-emotions"><a href="#2-embrace-your-strong-positives-emotions" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>2. Embrace your strong <del>positives</del> emotions</h3>\n<p>Neutral emotions don\'t have enough power to induce change. If you are feeling\na strong enough emotion, use it as fuel to change your behavior.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What emotions do you feel that drive the need to change your behavior?</li>\n<li>Why is this meaningful to you?</li>\n<li>Spend time with the emotion while you focus on your intention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: Jane feels embarrassed by her defensive reaction. She gets angry,\nlashes out which only results in negative responses back at her.</p>\n<p>It\'s meaningful to her to change her behavior because she wants to be more\napproachable, calm and relaxed in a conversation.</p>\n<p>She can reflect on this meaning with her emotions so that she can reinforce\nher intention.</p>\n<h3 id="3-visualize"><a href="#3-visualize" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>3. Visualize</h3>\n<p>Your brain is awesome but filled with trickery. Imagination can become reality.\nYou can use this to your advantage to train your brain into new habits by\nmentally rehearsing them. This strengthens the ability to form new habits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What imagery aligns with changing your behavior?</li>\n<li>Visualize them daily</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: Jane could imagine being questioned by a colleague. She could imagine\ndifferent types of questioning styles specifically the ones that make her\ndefensive.</p>\n<p>She could visualize scenes where she responds to these questions in a more\napproachable manner.</p>\n<h3 id="4-take-actions-that-support-your-intention"><a href="#4-take-actions-that-support-your-intention" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>4. Take actions that support your intention</h3>\n<p>Your behavior must align with your vocabulary. You need to fully believe\nyour actions. You need to identify what actions are aligned with your\nthoughts and emotions.</p>\n<p>Example: Jane cannot say that she will be approachable but when asked questions\nbecome defensive. Her behavior must mimic her intention through practice.</p>\n<p>If she gets it wrong, she can reflect and introspect to determine what she\nneeds to do to get it right.</p>\n<h3 id="5-repeat-repeat-repeat"><a href="#5-repeat-repeat-repeat" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>5. Repeat, repeat, repeat</h3>\n<p>You need to practice your new habit daily or you will fall back to your old\nways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do this consciously (mindfully) and daily</li>\n<li>Practice thinking, feeling, visualizing and acting in alignment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: Jane needs to be fully present in the moment of the conversation.\nShe needs to be aware of her body language, posture, vocabulary and tone.\nHer responses need to be as calm as possible and she must be aware of the\ntriggers that induce her rage.</p>\n<p>Through activating the different pathways and by practicing her intent\nshe could succeed at breaking away from this behavior she chooses to change.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Dr. Hilary Stokes continues to say that the key is to activate as many of these\npathways as possible given they work synergistically.</p>\n<p>One pathway is not enough to rewire your brain. You need to repeatedly align\nyour beliefs, feelings, vision, and actions to experience lasting changes in your brain.</p>\n<h2 id="my-final-thoughts"><a href="#my-final-thoughts" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>My final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Dr. Hilary Stokes\' article is powerful and elaborate.
