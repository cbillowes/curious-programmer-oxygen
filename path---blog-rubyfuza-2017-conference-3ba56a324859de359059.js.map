I did a lot of\\nstuff that I wouldn't have done before because I was scared of what people would\\nthink of me or didn't feel confident in myself to try it.</p>\\n<p>The scariest thing I signed up for was public speaking.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"panic\\\"><a href=\\\"#panic\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Panic!</h4>\\n<p>The idea makes my knees weak and my heart race. I get anxious and nauseous. My\\nthroat closes and I feel like I can't breathe properly.</p>\\n<p>Now, I don't have to wait to get onto the stage in front of everyone to feel this\\nway. In fact, from the day my talk got accepted until presenting it, I'd been\\nstruggling to cope with this.</p>\\n<p>I was getting panic attacks. Logic couldn't save me. Advice, suggestions or\\ntips didn't save me. It was bad.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"push-through\\\"><a href=\\\"#push-through\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Push Through</h4>\\n<p>It was something I wanted to achieve so I wanted to push through.

I prepared the content and practiced the delivery multiple times.</li>\\n<li><strong>Get a support structure</strong>: Without the support structure from amazing people\\nin my life I may have backed out.

Having that balance keeps you from becoming over-confident\\nand arrogant.</p>\\n<p>Here are some of the techniques that can help you find your balance.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Be honest with yourself</strong>:\\nJuggling all these feelings can be scary and overwhelming.\\nAccept that you are experiencing Imposter Syndrome and know that you can\\nwork through it.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>You are in control</strong>:\\nYou may feel like a victim but your mind is creating this bleak reality. You\\ncan actually control it even if it doesn't feel like it.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Calm your mind</strong>:\\nIf your mind is too busy then you can't focus or be in control. Realize that\\nyou are not your thoughts and feelings. They come and go, so you don't need\\nto be consumed by them.</p>\\n<p>Breathing, meditation and mindfulness practices can help you calm your mind.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Be kind to yourself</strong>:\\nBeing your own worst enemy isn't going to get you anywhere. Accept yourself\\nfor who you are and be conscious of the words you use to talk about yourself.</p>\\n<p>You are the most important person in your life. Look after yourself mentally,\\nphysically and emotionally.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Reflect</strong>:\\nThere are always things you can do to improve on. Reflect by asking yourself\\nwhat is going well, what isn't going so well and how can I improve?</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Talk about it</strong>:\\nSo many people are affected by this but few talk about it or even realize it.\\nKnow that you are not alone. You don't have to suffer in silence.</p>\\n<p>Get a different perspective on your performance and behavior by talking to\\npeople around you. You can also give back by sharing your experiences and\\nperspective.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Get support</strong>:\\nFind a mentor with a similar personality to get guidance that will help you\\nin situations where you struggle.</p>\\n<p>You could also start or join a meetup group where you have regular discussions\\nabout this.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Take it day by day</strong>:\\nIt's a bumpy road. Some days are good, others not so much.</p>\\n<p>I have to put in a lot of effort and sometimes I feel like I'm right back at\\nthe beginning of this road.</p>\\n<p>I just take it day by day and try not to be hard on myself. I am only human.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Get outside your comfort zone</strong>:\\nIt's easy to stagnate in this place of comfort. If you want to grow then do\\nsomething that scares you, something you haven't done before or learn a new\\nskill.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>And when all else fails, do what Barney Stinson says <strong>\\\"When I'm sad I stop being\\nsad and be awesome instead.\\\"</strong></p>\\n<p>Why go through life missing out on opportunities, constantly putting yourself\\ndown and being scared of how other people see you?</p>\\n<p>You are not immortal, so take your life back!</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p><strong>The Imposter Test</strong></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://paulineroseclance.com/pdf/IPscoringtest.pdf\\\">The Clance IP Test</a> was\\ndeveloped by clinical psychologist Pauline Clance to help individuals determine\\nwhether or not they have Imposter Syndrome characteristics, and if so, to what\\nextent they are suffering.</p>\\n<p>After taking the Imposter Test, add together the numbers of the responses to\\neach statement. If the total score is 40 or less, the respondent has few\\nImposter characteristics; if the score is between 41 and 60, the respondent has\\nmoderate IP experiences; a score between 61 and 80 means the respondent\\nfrequently has Imposter feelings; and a score higher than 80 means the\\nrespondent often has intense IP experiences. The higher the score, the more\\nfrequently and seriously the Imposter Phenomenon interferes in a person’s life.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2 id=\\\"resources\\\"><a href=\\\"#resources\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Resources</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/slides/rubyfuza-2017-the-imposter-within.pdf\\\">Download the slides (PDF)</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkgAc0DY4s8\\\">YouTube Recording</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/i/moments/830378337516322816\\\">Twitter Moments</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://beatImpostersyndrome.net/\\\">Beat Imposter Syndrome</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-202-clarice-bouwer-leaving-comfort-behind\\\">Leaving Comfort Behind</a> - Episode 202 on the Developer On Fire podcast</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx\\\">I'm a phony.

Having that balance keeps you from becoming over-confident\\nand arrogant.</p>\\n<p>Here are some of the techniques that can help you find your balance.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Be honest with yourself</strong>:\\nJuggling all these feelings can be scary and overwhelming.\\nAccept that you are experiencing Imposter Syndrome and know that you can\\nwork through it.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>You are in control</strong>:\\nYou may feel like a victim but your mind is creating this bleak reality. You\\ncan actually control it even if it doesn't feel like it.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Calm your mind</strong>:\\nIf your mind is too busy then you can't focus or be in control. Realize that\\nyou are not your thoughts and feelings. They come and go, so you don't need\\nto be consumed by them.</p>\\n<p>Breathing, meditation and mindfulness practices can help you calm your mind.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Be kind to yourself</strong>:\\nBeing your own worst enemy isn't going to get you anywhere. Accept yourself\\nfor who you are and be conscious of the words you use to talk about yourself.</p>\\n<p>You are the most important person in your life. Look after yourself mentally,\\nphysically and emotionally.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Reflect</strong>:\\nThere are always things you can do to improve on. Reflect by asking yourself\\nwhat is going well, what isn't going so well and how can I improve?</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Talk about it</strong>:\\nSo many people are affected by this but few talk about it or even realize it.\\nKnow that you are not alone. You don't have to suffer in silence.</p>\\n<p>Get a different perspective on your performance and behavior by talking to\\npeople around you. You can also give back by sharing your experiences and\\nperspective.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Get support</strong>:\\nFind a mentor with a similar personality to get guidance that will help you\\nin situations where you struggle.</p>\\n<p>You could also start or join a meetup group where you have regular discussions\\nabout this.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Take it day by day</strong>:\\nIt's a bumpy road. Some days are good, others not so much.</p>\\n<p>I have to put in a lot of effort and sometimes I feel like I'm right back at\\nthe beginning of this road.</p>\\n<p>I just take it day by day and try not to be hard on myself. I am only human.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Get outside your comfort zone</strong>:\\nIt's easy to stagnate in this place of comfort. If you want to grow then do\\nsomething that scares you, something you haven't done before or learn a new\\nskill.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>And when all else fails, do what Barney Stinson says <strong>\\\"When I'm sad I stop being\\nsad and be awesome instead.\\\"</strong></p>\\n<p>Why go through life missing out on opportunities, constantly putting yourself\\ndown and being scared of how other people see you?</p>\\n<p>You are not immortal, so take your life back!</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p><strong>The Imposter Test</strong></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://paulineroseclance.com/pdf/IPscoringtest.pdf\\\">The Clance IP Test</a> was\\ndeveloped by clinical psychologist Pauline Clance to help individuals determine\\nwhether or not they have Imposter Syndrome characteristics, and if so, to what\\nextent they are suffering.</p>\\n<p>After taking the Imposter Test, add together the numbers of the responses to\\neach statement. If the total score is 40 or less, the respondent has few\\nImposter characteristics; if the score is between 41 and 60, the respondent has\\nmoderate IP experiences; a score between 61 and 80 means the respondent\\nfrequently has Imposter feelings; and a score higher than 80 means the\\nrespondent often has intense IP experiences. The higher the score, the more\\nfrequently and seriously the Imposter Phenomenon interferes in a person’s life.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2 id=\\\"resources\\\"><a href=\\\"#resources\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Resources</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/slides/rubyfuza-2017-the-imposter-within.pdf\\\">Download the slides (PDF)</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkgAc0DY4s8\\\">YouTube Recording</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/i/moments/830378337516322816\\\">Twitter Moments</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://beatImpostersyndrome.net/\\\">Beat Imposter Syndrome</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-202-clarice-bouwer-leaving-comfort-behind\\\">Leaving Comfort Behind</a> - Episode 202 on the Developer On Fire podcast</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx\\\">I'm a phony.
