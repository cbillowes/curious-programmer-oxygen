This\nis guaranteed. It doesn\'t matter how many years experience they have, they need\nto learn everything about the business, products and the people from the ground\nup. This takes a <a href="/blog/time-is-precious">lot of time</a>.</p>\n<p>We shouldn\'t just throw people into the deep end with everything. "Bend a tree\nwhile it is still growing."</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Give them a solid welcome pack with important HR and company familiarity\ndocuments. It should act like a map with a "you are here" in this business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access cards, user accounts and all technical requirements need to be available\non the start date. Someone joining a company is eager and excited. Idle time\nis going to be frustrating.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Orientation needs to be ongoing for a few months. One day is too overwhelming\nin large companies and not everyone is going to retain all that knowledge that\nis crammed into their minds.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assign a mentor for the next year so they have a dedicated person to guide and\nhelp them along.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don\'t assign them to a team straight away. Sure you may desperately need\nprofessionals in some teams but this is only going to slow down the delivery and cause\nunnecessary frustrations within a team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Instead let them join a team of their choice and pair on bite-sized chunks of\nwork. Perhaps they could be rotated every sprint up to about four sprints.\nThis should be less invasive and give them more exposure to teams, products,\npeople and technology. By pairing, they don\'t have the pressures of setting up\ntheir environments fully but as they have their machines they can start\nexploring codebases and read up where they can.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After the rotation period is up, let the person choose from a list of priority\nteams - teams who need developers. Let the team have an informal interview\nwith the candidate to identify a possible fit. Forced placements don\'t\nencourage a sense of autonomy within the team and if the person doesn\'t fit\nwell in the team, everyone is left discouraged.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="focus-on-staff-retention"><a href="#focus-on-staff-retention" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Focus on staff retention</h2>\n<p>The customer is very important but without your staff there will be no customer.\nI would get my managers to focus on keeping their staff happy while the staff\ncan focus on keeping the customers happy.</p>\n<p>If someone is frustrated in a team and it cannot be resolved, perhaps they are\nnot suited for the team.

Isn\'t it better to receive a bonus based on the value you add to\nthe company within your role?</p>\n<p>Money aside, people want to grow in their craft.
