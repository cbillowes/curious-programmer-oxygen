This\ndesperation has left me exhausted as I a played a cyclic game.\nI tormented myself because <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Apurpose">purpose</a>\nis <strong>a person\'s sense of resolve or determination</strong> and I felt I had none.</p>\n<p>While talking to a very good friend of mine, I came to realize that I want to\n<strong>intentionally contribute in order to add value</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well now, there\'s a bunch of complicated and overloaded words that require\nsome unpacking. At least it\'s more elaborate than <em>purpose</em>. Each statement\nin the unpacking process requires its own <strong>why</strong> and <strong>what does it mean to\nme</strong> in order to get to the bottom of our complex desires, or at least get\nclose enough to fulfillment.</p>\n<p>I had an epiphany a few weeks ago. What\'s the point of finding a purpose if I\ndon\'t know who I am? I need to discover myself first - a journey I\'ve been on\nfor quite some time now. Maybe that is my purpose? Who knows.</p>\n<p>The information I wish to share with you today, is information I gathered during\na self-healing process on my road to self-discovery.</p>\n<h2 id="personal-identity"><a href="#personal-identity" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Personal identity</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No one saves us but ourselves.

The world just keeps\nturning and people just keep <em>peopling</em>.</p>\n<p>I can really start to listen to life. I can see it\'s story as it happens to me. I can\nfigure it out day by day and decide what it is that I want that will make me\nhappy or improve my sense of self-worth.</p>\n<p>Sure life can really suck and as I know I can\'t control it and it doesn\'t care\nabout my logic or rationality, I can just let it happen to me. Accept it.</p>\n<p>I know I have the capacity to go anywhere and do whatever I want.\nI just need to live with consequences of whatever actions I choose. Are the\nconsequences destructive or rewarding? Is the choice feasible? A quick\nrationalization hardly does any harm.</p>\n<p>I\'m so sucked in by my self-limiting beliefs and poor perspective that I don\'t\nrealize that I am in control of my life, my thoughts, my feelings and my behavior.\nI have power over me - even though I rarely believe it.</p>\n<h2 id="suffering"><a href="#suffering" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Suffering</h2>\n<p>We get hurt by people, circumstances and all the things that hurt us that are\noutside of our control.

Anger leads to hate.\nHate leads to suffering. ~ Yoda (George Lucas)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When we are in the dark side (which is neither good nor bad), it becomes hard\nto realize that people act differently within their\nown parameters of limitations, insecurities, needs, finances, concerns, emotions,\nenvironments and circumstances. This is when we may experience unhealthy levels\nof fear, anger, hurt, sadness, pain and suffering.</p>\n<p>We can spiral downward into a chaotic emotional mess if we allow it to happen.\nSometimes we are not aware of these parameters because we are the hero\'s or lead\nactors/actresses in our own lives.</p>\n<p>This can be confusing. Understanding the logic but implementing in action are\ntwo different things. In the heat of the moment it is easy to lose control\nand lash out as an emotional defense.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger.\n~ Buddha</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I learned that I need to heal my perception of the people who have hurt me.\nI need to <strong>heal the person within</strong> me.\n"I love you.
