Make sure to take it. It\'s important.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, my husband and I went to Mauritius for 7 days for a wedding.\nIt was my first island experience and I have been wanting to go there for years.\nThis was a great opportunity for me to switch off from the world and relax.</p>\n<p>In my experience software developers are on standby almost all the time. This\nmakes taking leave and actually relaxing somewhat troublesome. I didn\'t want\nto feel anxious throughout my vacation so this is the advice I can give you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Make your leave visible in advance</strong><br/>\nWe have a leave calendar on our wall so that everyone in the team can see\nwhen leave has been taken to aid with planning work for the upcoming sprint.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tie up lose ends before leaving</strong><br/>\nGo on leave knowing that you have done your best to tie up lose ends. If you\nhave a task in progress, make sure that it is either finished or someone\nelse knows how to continue the task without you. If you don\'t, you will worry\nabout it the whole time you are away.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create an automated Out Of Office reply</strong><br/>\nAs simple as it sounds, it\'s very easy to forget. People who email you need to\nknow that you are out of the office.</p>\n<p>Direct them to other people they can get in touch with while you are away.\nMention when you are back in the office so that they are aware and can make\ndecisions around that information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cancel your meetings</strong><br/>\nMake sure that you cancel your meetings before going on leave. Not everyone\nwill know that you are away.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Switch off all notifications</strong><br/>\nI made sure my phone didn\'t spam me with all sorts of notifications and emails\nwhile I was on my trip. My phone was on silent most of the time. I didn\'t\nenable roaming.</p>\n<p>I allowed myself a few moments on some days to check Whatsapp for any dire cases\nbut only one occurred and the team was on it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Remember, the world goes on without you</strong><br/>\nWhen something breaks and you form part of a team where you are not a key\nperson dependency, you can reward yourself with deserved downtime.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Relax</strong><br/>\nThere were all sorts of activities I could do to fill up my days. I didn\'t\nwant to come back tired and exhausted so I made sure to commit to only a few\nactivities and enjoy every moment of my stay—busy or not.\nI came back happy, relaxed and calmer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="weekend-getaways"><a href="#weekend-getaways" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Weekend getaways</h2>\n<p>Smaller getaways can be taken throughout the year that don\'t necessarily\nrequire any leave.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inspect your calendar for long weekends throughout the year.</li>\n<li>Make a note of these breaks well in advance.</li>\n<li>Try to schedule a camping trip, road trip, hiking, B&#x26;B or some other getaway\nif your finances allow for it.</li>\n<li>If you can\'t afford something, try to do something you don\'t ordinarily do\njust for a different experience.</li>\n<li>Try not to <strong>feel busy</strong>.

Even if it\'s just 5 to 10 minutes. Caroline Webb suggests that one\nshould take a break after every 90 minutes of work.</p>\n<p>The break should be away from your desk and should allow your mind some time\nto replenish. What you do in your break is up to you but here are some\nsuggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Breathe</strong><br/>\nEspecially if you are feeling agitated. Take a few deep breaths to calm down\nand settle your mind.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Go for a walk</strong><br/>\nGo outside to get some fresh air. Walking offers a form of exercise and\ngoing outside offers a nice change of scenery depending on where you work.</p>\n<p>If outside doesn\'t work for you (pollution / not safe / cold) then just walk\nsomewhere else in the building. Take stairs. Go for coffee. Just do something\nelse away from your desk that doesn\'t offer a negative side-effect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Write/Draw something</strong><br/>\nIf you are struggling with something, go sit somewhere away from your desk.\nMap out what you are doing on paper. Visualizing the problem could\nillustrate possible solutions that you couldn\'t see before.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Talk to someone</strong><br/>\nWalk to someone and talk to them about the problem you are working on.\nListen to what is said objectively. Suggestions don\'t need to be implemented\nbut they may contain insights that you may not have thought of before\nin your mentally clouded state.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reflect</strong><br/>\nGive yourself time to reflect after completing a task. Knowing what you know\nnow, what would you do differently in the future?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lunch</strong><br/>\nTry not to eat lunch at your desk. Take time to eat lunch with your colleagues\nand find yourself talking about interesting conversations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A break should not be to waste time or escape something critical but rather to\nboost your mind and productivity. Experiment until you find the thing that\nboosts yours.</p>\n<h2 id="my-final-thoughts"><a href="#my-final-thoughts" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>My final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Downtime is essential.
