It sounded amazing in\ntheory but it didn\'t meet my expectations.</p>\n<p>What were my expectations? Who knows! I was brainwashed by the working culture\nadvertised by exciting start-ups and big-kids like Google, Facebook and\nNetflix. I don\'t think that these companies lie about their environments but I\ndo think that people over the fence aren\'t exposed to the gnarly parts.</p>\n<p>I was emotionally attached to a unicorn - that I couldn\'t find.</p>\n<p>Every company - big and small - has its ups and downs. When I realized the\nunicorn may in fact not exist, it brought me back down to earth and my\nperspective changed. This makes for a more welcoming work environment and a\nhappier state of mind.</p>\n<h2 id="everyone-is-better-than-me"><a href="#everyone-is-better-than-me" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Everyone is better than me</h2>\n<p>I started browsing the web before it exploded into a global obsession.\nThe intimate web I used to know was filled with Times New Roman, Comic Sans\nand pages with solar flares among other horrors.

This is where you need to find that sweet spot between getting stuff\ndone and making stuff perfect.</p>\n<p>The corporate world exposes you to a lot of people with a lot of opinions.
