I said goodbye to some amazing people at MultiChoice on Monday. I've learned so much over the past 4 years and am glad to have made some good friends. I was so nervous that day as I would start my new job on Tuesday.

I knew how much I had to learn and felt so overwhelmed. I was throwing myself into the deep end but that's my philosophy. I rarely stay in a comfort zone for long.

Today closes my first week at CloudAfrica and what a blast! It has been an incredible jump in my programming career. Here's what I've learned this week.

## I don't like to travel
I don't like to travel that much that I booked a week in an Airbnb about 6 minutes away from the offices. Not only was I close to work but I felt like I had a mini vacation. I could wake up later and feel well rested.

## I don't like to drive
The first day my nerves were up. I took an Uber and it felt so good to not have to drive. I sat back and relaxed a bit while someone else did the heavy lifting. I did that a few times during the week.

## I have a lot to learn
Not only is there the Linux jump from Microsoft but I'll be jumping into Clojure that I am excited about, there is also Clojurescript and with that comes Reframe (a Reagent framework for writing SPAs) and the hiccup syntax. That is just the tip of the iceberg.

Eventually I'll run out of money if I keep Ubering and Airbnb-ing but for now I am enjoying the luxury of not having to worry about this mundane element in my daily commute. I still feel overwhelmed but I am equally excited to grow and learn at CloudAfrica!
