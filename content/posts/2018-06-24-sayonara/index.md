I've been very quite. A year's worth of quiet. I'm sorry. I'm still here. I still
plan on blogging, just a little differently now.

Life is a strange business you see. People come and they go no matter how
much you want them to stay. After integrating into DStv Digital Media four years ago,
I have had my share of welcomes and farewells. Now I bid farewell on 2 July 2018.

I grew professionally and personally while building cool stuff, making friends,
sharing laughs, shedding tears, getting burned by my decisions and by factors outside
of my control, and by playing silly buggers - because age is just a number.
As I was employed there for almost half a decade of my life, I would hope for nothing less.
This roller coaster journey was worth the thrill.

Looking back at the silliest thing I have done was writing professionally contextual
yet humorous gobbledygook in JIRA stories and emails as I honestly believe people don't
read them. *Ssssshhhhh! Don't! Tell! Anyone!* It's a helluva lot of fun writing out silly
long-winded statements. Pretty much like I am doing here I guess.

**But it's still sad to leave people behind!** *Assuming they're awesome people that is,
which in most cases they are, even if you don't think they are, they probably are.
Just ask around or give them time. You'll see.*

I did make a lot of friends and smile relationships - a smile relationship is a relationship
whereby neither individual has met yet in passing, they smile and maybe throw in a wave.

I am definitely going to miss the people the most. It's always the people that make
it the hardest to leave.

As I leave the corporate world, **corporate programmer** is re-branded to **curious programmer**.
More to come on my journey going forward.
