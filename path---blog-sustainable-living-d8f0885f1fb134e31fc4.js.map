Once the end has been reached and things slow down again, I get\\nsick and feel exhausted. I think that's where I am now.</p>\\n<p>As I'm still figuring things out I am not concerned but I would like to document\\nthe progress and things I am learning through this journey.</p>\\n<p>I must say that although I am feeling exhausted, I don't feel as overwhelmed as\\nI used to.

Throughout the last 6 months or so, these\\npractices have become a part of me and aid me in my new journey:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>I leave for work and head home outside of peak traffic times to avoid\\nunnecessary frustrations.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>I am practicing <strong><a href=\\\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/6-ways-journaling-will-change-your-life.html\\\">journaling</a></strong>\\nwhere I write about my day to find out more about myself, allow myself time\\nto reflect and process my thoughts.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>I am training myself to singletask instead of multitask to improve the quality\\nof work I deliver as well as my mental wellbeing.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>When I am stressed, I pause, take a few deep breaths to calm myself down.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>I make sure to meditate each day for a minimum of 10 minutes using the\\nHeadspace or Buddify apps.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>I see a counselling psychologist monthly for coaching in both my career and\\npersonal life.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>I attend an hour of Pilates and hour of Yoga class each week for exercise, to\\nstrengthen my core, improve my posture and for better headspace.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>I am reading up about Behavioral Science and how it can improve my working\\nlife.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>I observe and converse with others to learn more about life and how others\\nare coping.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>I try not to look at my phone all the time.

I find many challenges and I don't always get it right. I am not\\ngetting enough sleep and I am feeling a bit ill but I don't belittle myself.\\nI just keep trying and it's working.</p>\\n<p>I am seeing signs of improvement. I am more approachable and I am getting more done\\nthan before. My days feel more meaningful and already this is more sustainable\\nthan my drifting \\\"what the hell did I do today?\\\" type of days.</p>\\n<p>Admittedly my blog took a bit of strain as I decided some downtime was required\\nbut so be it.</p>\\n<p>I am eager to know your thoughts and perspective on this topic.
