In my\nopinion I want to be able to get out of depression easier and cope better\nwith anger, stress and anxiety. I want to let go of unhealthy behaviors.\nThe idea is to make me healthier so that I can be more productive,\napproachable and calmer.</p>\n<p>I want to get out of the victim role where there is blame and disadvantage\nand into the creator role where I use my circumstances to my advantage to\ncontrol my present destiny.</p>\n<p>I was captivated by an article titled “5 Ways to Rewire Your Brain for\nMeaningful Life Changes”. It’s about activating neuro pathways to create\nnew neural networks in the brain.</p>\n<p>My article is a summary of the original for documentation purposes and\nadaptation of my understanding of the content as best I can.</p>\n<p><a href="/blog/rewire-your-brain-1">Read more</a></p>\n<h2 id="activate-neuro-pathways"><a href="#activate-neuro-pathways" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Activate Neuro Pathways</h2>\n<p>We looked at how we can activate five neuro pathways in order to create new\nneural networks in the brain.
