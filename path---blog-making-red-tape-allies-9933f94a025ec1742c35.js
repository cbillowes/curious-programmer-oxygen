Many refer to such obstacles as red-tape.</p>\n<p>This can be anything from proxy or network related constraints to unaligned\nenvironment configurations to corporate governance and change control.</p>\n<p>Whatever the red-tape is that you face, it can be really frustrating as it\nslows down or completely impedes progressing work into production.</p>\n<p>Luckily for you, corporates tend to have a lot of people. It is likely that they\nexperience or have experienced the same frustrations as you. This means you\nhave <strong>a complete internal knowledge-base</strong> that you can utilize to aid you.\nBuild relationships with these people. This is what I mean by red-tape allies.</p>\n<p>If you are new to the corporate world or to the particular corporate\norganization, the red-tape and the amount of people can be overwhelming. Start\nby networking with your team and get them to introduce you to other people\nthat you can learn from. If you aren\'t the shy type, go introduce yourself.</p>\n<p>Obviously it takes time to meet people, learn about the company, your product\nand how to overcome red-tape but you never have to feel stuck and alone.</p>\n<h2 id="network"><a href="#network" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Network</h2>\n<p>Grow your network of people that can aid you with solving red-tape.</p>\n<p>Start networking with software developers from other teams. Drop in for a quick\nvisit to see how other teams do things or chat to them during lunch, grabbing a\ncup of coffee or while at the water cooler.</p>\n<p>If you have remote teams, try video conferencing or chatting to them over\nwhatever medium it is that they may be using.</p>\n<p>Include developer leads, line managers or other managers in your network.\nThey may or may not be directly involved with the team you are in.</p>\n<p>Leads and managers usually have the bigger picture in mind and can offer a lot\nof strategic insights that might aid you even more.</p>\n<p>IT and Security Engineers have a lot of insights to what is happening on the\ncompany network, with antivirus scans and the proxy servers. If you include\nthem in your personal network, you could gain insights and assistance that\ncould help you easily resolve issues.</p>\n<p>I\'ve found networking with non-technical people to be advantageous. They can\ngive ideas and food-for-thought to certain obstacles you face. They can\nask you a bunch of thought-provoking questions so that they can try understand\nthe problem which could lead you on the right path.</p>\n<h2 id="share-ideas"><a href="#share-ideas" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Share ideas</h2>\n<p>Start chatting to other people about things that frustrate you or impede your\nwork.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to be objective so that you don\'t cling to your frustrations as\nit impedes the ability to find solutions. It\'s equally important that you\ndon\'t come across as offensive as people will shy away from you.</p>\n<p><strong>Listen</strong> to suggestions and opinions objectively. People will be sharing their\npersonal experiences with you. They are not forcing you to do anything, even if\nit sounds that way.</p>\n<p>So remember that it doesn\'t mean that you have to go and change everything in\nyour team. Simply extract useful information that you and your team can apply\nand keep the rest in mind.</p>\n<p>The same mindset needs to be had when you share your newfound ideas with your\nteam. Try not to impose drastic changes that could unravel the balance your\nteam has. Try to suggest quick experiments that could give you the most gains\nto see if they will work.</p>\n<p>Our company has a monthly demo day where each team demonstrates the work they\nhave done in the last two sprints. This is an ideal platform to share how\nimpediments were improved or resolved by discussing how the team streamlined\ndifferent processes and what small experiments were introduced within the sprint.</p>\n<p>Mistakes are also a great way to learn how not to do things. Gladly share them\nand learn through the mistakes of others.</p>\n<h2 id="document"><a href="#document" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Document</h2>\n<p>Share your learnings with your team and try to document it on a central\nknowledge base whether it be an online Wiki, blog or Q&#x26;A platform.
