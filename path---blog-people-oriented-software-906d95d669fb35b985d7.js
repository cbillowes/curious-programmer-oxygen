To me, writing code\nis a small subset of software development.</p>\n<p>We write software for a reason. What that reason is depends on the people who\nwill be using that software. I have a lot of fun writing code but I have more\nfun making software with people for people.</p>\n<p>There are interesting challenges that materialize when people start working\ntogether. Especially so when there is a lot of\n<a href="#side-note">unnecessary complicatedness</a> in an\norganizational structure. We all want different things for different reasons\nwith our own ideas, past experiences and understandings. Tackling these\nchallenges to make for better software, delivery and happier teams &#x26; users is\nwhat I love thinking about. This is the crux of what I want to write about.</p>\n<p>The people we make software with are the:</p>\n<h2 id="user"><a href="#user" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>User</h2>\n<p>We can argue about the best technologies and implementations to use then write\ncode everyday until we turn into code writing zombies.
