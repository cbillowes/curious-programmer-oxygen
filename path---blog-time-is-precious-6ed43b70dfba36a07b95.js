Who\nknows how long I would have been stuck in that dreadful traffic?</p>\n<p>Before I rerouted, many drivers became reckless. The rules of the road were\ndiscarded. I guess this is due to frustration and desperation. Other drivers\nbecame annoyed and vocal.\nThere was no more room for courtesy as people were pushing in one after\nthe other.</p>\n<p>A metaphor hit me like a <a href="http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Pan_Galactic_Gargle_Blaster">pan galactic gargle blaster</a>.\nWe experience chaos like this in software development teams.
