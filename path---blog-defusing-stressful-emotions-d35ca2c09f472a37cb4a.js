Stress that is self-made\nand becomes unbearable because we make it so.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you need to take your car for a service but you are running late because there\nis a queue. Your anxiety starts shooting up because you are running late for work. The attendant\nslowly checks the car for scratches and your patience is thinning. You become snappy and\nhave to wait for a way back to the office. After getting stuck in five minutes traffic\nyou are fuming and want to loose your shit. Maybe you do. Maybe you don’t.</p>\n<p>The thing is, you could have avoided the stress and anxiety in many ways. Contact your boss\nor manager to let them know the situation. You can make alternate arrangements for time off work.\nThat one event can set the tone of the rest of your day.</p>\n<p>I have gathered some techniques which I try incorporate in my personal and work life to defuse\nand better handle stressful emotions.</p>\n<h3 id="question-the-unknown"><a href="#question-the-unknown" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Question the unknown</h3>\n<p>When dealing with unknown situations I ask myself three simple questions:</p>\n<p>What do I think is the worst possible realistic outcome of the situation?\nHow will I feel about it?\nWhat will I do about it?\nPresent in the moment</p>\n<p>I practice mindfulness by focusing on the present so that my intentions are deliberate and I\nam not thinly spread.

I can politely\nwalk away from a conversation or step out of a meeting: breathe, take a walk, read an article, listen\nto music, wash my face or grab a cup of coffee. I can re-enter the scenario once I have cooled down.\nStaying is just going to cause more harm than good.</p>\n<p>As software developers we have a lot of things that can stress us out from working with different\ntypes of people, dealing with conflict (people and merges) and the need to constantly manage expectations\nto technical related stresses like choosing the right technology, supporting unfamiliar projects and\nfighting fires in production.</p>\n<p>When we become stressed and our survival-mode kicks in, our judgements are often flawed and unnecessary\nmistakes are made. The same can apply for constant worrying as our thoughts take us on a journey of many\npaths constantly ripping us away from the present.</p>\n<h2 id="my-final-thoughts"><a href="#my-final-thoughts" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>My final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Stress doesn’t have to consume you. There are simple techniques that we can\napply to our daily lives to minimize the impact that it can have on us.</p>\n<p>Many stressful situations can be defused by taking a breath and objectively thinking about the\nsituation without judgment on yourself or those around you.</p>\n<p>By being more present in our day, we can be deliberate with our intentions which can make you more\nproductive and aware of the beautiful things around you.</p>\n<p>By being mindful in my day, I am more at peace. I am more relaxed. I am more awake. I have more time.\nI am more productive. I am more free. And this makes me happy.</p>\n<h2 id="references"><a href="#references" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>, a meditation app</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.mindful.org/five-steps-to-mindfulness/">Five steps to mindfulness</a> by Thich Nhat Hanh</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/stop-worrying/">12 Techniques to stop worrying</a> by Cindy Holbrook</li>\n<li><a href="https://medium.com/meditation-without-mysticism/meditation-isn-t-about-suppressing-your-thoughts-and-emotions-4de935d61213">Meditation isn’t about suppressing your thoughts and emotions</a> by J.
