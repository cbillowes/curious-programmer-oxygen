Making a name for yourself in the software\n> development community helps build street cred in the corporate world.\n\nWhen you join the corporate world, you become a number. At least, that is what\nI heard - and believed. The game involves a lot of players and you need to play\nor quit while you are ahead.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a number anyway? Is it someone who's opinions go\nunheard? Is it someone who just completes boring tasks to get a paycheck at the\nend of the month? I don't know the answer to this.\n\nI have opinions and ideas that I like sharing with others and skills that I\ncan contribute to different areas in the software development lifecycle. I\ndon't want to settle. I want to contribute.\n\nWhen I joined a corporate I was overwhelmed. This world has so many people,\na vast set of technologies, integration points, business rules, data and\nprocesses. It was daunting to say the least. How can you avoid to be just a\nnumber in this vast corporate ocean?\n\n## Create your identity\n\nLet me throw names out there: [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/),\n[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/), [John Sonmez](http://simpleprogrammer.com/),\n[Jon Skeet](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/), [Kent Beck](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?KentBeck),\n[Iris Classon](http://irisclasson.com/), [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/) and\n[Robert MacLean](http://www.sadev.co.za/).\n\nThese people are a small fraction in the global software development community\nand are sometimes seen as celebrities. They simply take the time to share their\nfindings with others **consistently**. They blog, tweet, speak at\nevents, write books and really get involved in the development community.\nThey have created an online identity - or brand - for themselves.\n\nImagine if you were a software celebrity starting at a corporate. You would\nalready be well known in the community so your identity would be rock solid.\n\nI tried blogging in my career. I had five separate blogs with a mixture of\ncontent that never gain traction. I probably posted under 10 posts in total. I\nwasn't consistent or focused. I failed dismally but have learned from my mistakes.\n\n> At the time of writing, John Sonmez at [simpleprogrammer.com](http://simpleprogrammer.com/)\n> is giving a free 3 week e-mail course to [boost](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/)\n> your software development career. The insights and tips provided here are a sure\n> way to create your own identity.\n\n## Build relationships\n\nYou are going to be working with a lot of different types of people. Roles seem\nto play a big part in the corporate game although I still find these lines blurry.\nDependencies can be like a large spider web and not everyone is aware of the\nbigger picture. It often feels like trying to find a gold needle in a tower of\nsilver needles - painful and almost impossible.\n\nIt is important to start speaking to the right people. With time and some\npersonal investment you can start building relationships in all parts of the\norganization. Figure out what people do and why they are doing it. If you are\nfriendly and helpful, people treat you the same way.\n\nThis is not some way of social engineering people to do what you need them to do.\nThis is about working with people and learning from them.\n\n## Sketch the bigger picture\n\nIf you stay confined to your immediate environment you have little exposure.\nAs you start building your relationships and understanding what and why things\nare being done, you get exposure to the bigger picture.\n\nWhen something goes wrong with a dependency our team uses, I go to that team,\nshow them the problem and work with them to help solve it. This gets easier the\nmore I learn about the company and its people who make it a success.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nIf you consider joining a corporate and are worried about being a number,\njust remember that you have control. If you want to be a number, you will\nbe. If you don't, get out of your comfort zone and start talking.\nBuild your identity and relationships. You learn so much just by talking to\nother people and corporates tend to have a lot of people.\n",

Perfection\n> is a subjective perspective. I dive into this \"illusion\" and how it has\n> affected me.\n\nMedia often creates a perception of everything being\n[\"perfect\"](http://elitedaily.com/life/perfect-just-illusion/1063793/). Billboards,\nmagazines, company websites, social media and television are all flooded\nwith images of perfection. The scary part is it applies to everything:\nthe perfect body; the perception of natural beauty; the ideal places to live;\nthe best vacation; the most awesome places to work; the desired brands;\nand the list goes on.\n\nThe art that media paints in our minds are picturesque. Who doesn't want to\nbe exposed to such beauty to \"enhance\" our daily lives?\n\nI am not sucker punching the media whether it be linear, digital or physical; I\njust want to use it to illustrate the illusion of perfection that is created.\n\n## Searching for a unicorn\n\nI was disappointed when I started working at a corporate. It sounded amazing in\ntheory but it didn't meet my expectations.\n\nWhat were my expectations? Who knows! I was brainwashed by the working culture\nadvertised by exciting start-ups and big-kids like Google, Facebook and\nNetflix. I don't think that these companies lie about their environments but I\ndo think that people over the fence aren't exposed to the gnarly parts.\n\nI was emotionally attached to a unicorn - that I couldn't find.\n\nEvery company - big and small - has its ups and downs. When I realized the\nunicorn may in fact not exist, it brought me back down to earth and my\nperspective changed. This makes for a more welcoming work environment and a\nhappier state of mind.\n\n## Everyone is better than me\n\nI started browsing the web before it exploded into a global obsession.\nThe intimate web I used to know was filled with Times New Roman, Comic Sans\nand pages with solar flares among other horrors. It wasn't filled with perfection.\n\nThis new world is filled with achievement and perfect people. I'm really hard on\nmyself when I see young billionaires; and read articles, author biographies and\ncode from others online. \"You should work harder so that you can get\nsomewhere,\" I tell myself.\n\nWhen I joined a corporate, this nightmare hit harder as it was no longer\njust in the online world. Perhaps everyone is just better than me?\n\n### Well, maybe - but also maybe not\n\nI started observing the people I admire. When I started listening carefully\nI picked up that these people - no matter how famous or experienced - all have fears like I do.\nMany feel like [imposters](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx) or\nthat they are [not good enough](http://devpressed.com/t/im-supposedly-a-senior-software-engineer-but-i-dont-feel-like-it/483/7).\n\nSome people just stick their necks out and [give stuff a try](http://irisclasson.com/2016/03/01/what-if-i-suck-confessions-of-a-wtf-contributor-by-iris-classon/).\nThat's what I started doing.\n\n-   I took a [blogging course](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/) from\n    John Sonmez at [simpleprogrammer.com](http://simpleprogrammer.com) and got amazing feedback directly from him.\n-   I submitted an article to [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com) and it got\n    accepted.\n-   I was asked if I want to give an [Ignite talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event))\n    at an event just because I got involved in our local software development\n    community.\n\nThese are big wins for me which my former self would never have achieved because\nmy fear crippled me. Hell, I am still scared but I just do it anyway.\n\n## The perfect code\n\nWhen you start programming, the coolest thing is to see your instructions\nmaterialize on a device of some sort. It doesn't matter how spaghetti it is. If\nyou can interact with it and it does what you want it to do, you have a\n\"[drumroll... hit cymbals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R5gHF0vzew)\" moment.\n\nAs the years go by your taste of pasta code diminishes and you strive for the\nperfect solution. This can be debilitating at times.\n\nWorking on your craft is important and you should always try to write\nthe best code you can in the moment but it shouldn't cripple you. Writing code\nis fun and when we get blinded by perfection, we lose some of that fun.\n\n### Programming in the real world\n\nWhen you work for a company, you are paid to produce code. The business doesn't\noften care about how it gets done as long as it does get done. When you write\ncode that becomes hard to maintain, it takes longer for you and the team to make\nadjustments. This is where you need to find that sweet spot between getting stuff\ndone and making stuff perfect.\n\nThe corporate world exposes you to a lot of people with a lot of opinions. If\nyou struggle with perfectionism and also try to follow what everyone says you\n**must** do, you won't deliver a thing.\n\nTake what you can from others but allow yourself to make mistakes. When you do,\nyou **need** to learn from them.\n\n## Redefining happiness\n\nSteve Handel wrote that the problem with perfectionism is that it [destroys happiness](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/how-perfectionism-destroys-happiness).\nHe mentions that it can \"negatively influence your work\"\nas it can lead to procrastination and \"workaholism\". These are two spectrums but\nI've experienced them both. I'd work really hard at work but procrastinate on\npersonal projects.\n\nYou can't just turn of your perfection switch. That's like telling someone who is\nangry to calm down. It just amplifies the situation because there is more\nfocus on it.\n\nWhat I propose to do is to redefine what happiness means to me so that I know\nwhat I want to work towards. Steve has some nice tips and exercises in his\narticle for you follow.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nPerfection is sometimes a crippling illusion whether it be what you see, where\nyou are, your experiences or what people tell you. Stop chasing unicorns,\nbelieving that you are worthless, and stressing yourself out because your code\nsucks. Realize that even the perfect picture has its flaws in the background and that\nwhat you are experiencing in life can actually be as close to perfect as it is.\n\nOnce the \"illusion\" is shattered, you may feel yourself being happier.\n",

Business won't know when things are not working\n> out unless you tell them. It is surprising how much support we can get\n> when we open honest channels of communication.\n\nLet's say you've settled into a corporate. You start working on a story but you horribly misjudged\nits complexity. The deadline is looming but you just can't figure it out.\nEverything you try has more obstacles or - even worse - results in dead ends.\nYou pull out every trick from your developer toolbox but you're stuck.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, your product owner pops by for a quick update. This wasn't\nyour first interruption: you had to help a developer with a bug in the\nsystem; a stakeholder popped by to ask you what you thought\nof an idea that sprung to mind; a designer needed some CSS assistance; your\nmanager scheduled a one-on-one with you; a friend called you to ask for some\nadvice; and you had a lot of network related issues.\nThis latest intrusion leaves you at breaking point.\n\n\"Perhaps if people quit harassing me, I'd probably be done by now,\" you\nbadly want to shout out so that everyone can hear you and leave you alone.\nInstead you reserve yourself as best you can and provide a report.\n\nDeep down inside you realize something profound:\n\n## What you allow will continue\n\nPeople can't read minds. At least not in my experience. If they can, they hide\nit well. Regardless, if you allow intrusions, it will continue.\n\nPeople don't wake up each morning thinking of ways to get you worked up.\n_At least I hope not!_ They generally have reasons for interrupting you -\nwhether they are important or not is often <a href=\"#understanding-human-beings\">debatable</a>.\n\nI strongly recommend you communicate your expectations with those around you.\nIt could be as simple as setting up a working agreement with your team and\nbusiness. You could find ways to deal with pesky\n[distractions](http://www.computus.org/journal/7-tips-for-programming-in-the-zone/)\nand learn techniques to [manage your time](http://alistapart.com/article/pickle).\n\nI want to focus on one distraction in particular: business stakeholders\ninterrupting you for a progress update.\n\n## Keep business informed\n\nIf you don't want to have product owners intruding, you need to keep them\ninformed. They have to report to a bunch of other business people and if they\nare in the dark, they **will** hunt you down.\n\n> It's simple: have open and honest [communication](http://study.com/academy/lesson/open-communication-in-the-workplace-definition-skills-benefits.html)\n> between your team and business.\n\nLet's delve into some situations:\n\n### Communicate interruptions\n\nInterruptions don't disappear once you put steps into place. You need to \"untrain\"\nwhat you have allowed in the past. You need to be strict with yourself and those\naround you.\n\n-   Lean heavily on your scrum master for guidance and assistance.\n-   Be mindful of emergencies and act accordingly.\n-   If you are interrupted, communicate your expectations with that person.\n    If the team is at fault and you can't deal with it immediately,\n    bring it up directly after the next standup.\n-   If it really gets out of hand, let your product owner know so that business\n    expectations can be managed and you can get more guidance.\n\n> Be aware that if you whine about interruptions without taking action, it could\n> look like you are making excuses.\n\n### Underestimated complexity\n\nThe moment you realize you have underestimated something, seek guidance from\nyour team. If you can't resolve it, immediately inform your product owner - in\nperson if you can (draft up an email afterwards if you need an audit trail).\nExplain the situation in **non-technical** terms. Use a whiteboard or\ndraw pictures.\n\nBusiness values this because they can manage expectations upward much quicker.\nIf you bring it up for the first time at a deadline - well, you're skrewed.\n\n### Catastrophic failure\n\nWhen someone tells you that something is broken in production, immediately\ninform your product owner.\n\nYour product owner needs to provide guidance. Not everything that breaks in production is\ncatastrophic. Yes, I just said that. We see production as the\nholy land where everything must be perfect. You may end up chasing a white rabbit\nbumping into Alice along the way if you go down this hole - and it's not going to\nbe an adventure.\n\n#### Understanding business value\n\nTrying to fix everything in production _(especially if you are new to a product)_,\ncould waste valuable time and increase stress. You need to understand the business value\nattached to it. Say you start fixing it only to find out that:\n\n-   The product or feature is obsolete.\n-   You should be working on something that has a bigger impact on customers or business.\n-   There are more pressing issues that need immediate attention.\n-   Another team is already working on it.\n\nYou definitely need guidance from business.\n\n#### Understanding human-beings\n\nYou are surrounded by a lot of people at corporates. Everyone has their own ideas\nof how things should work - and they will tell you. This is terribly\noverwhelming if you are new to this world.\n\nDon't take value out of every word that is said to you. If you are told that\nsomething is broken in production, seek guidance. The longer you stay in your\nenvironment, the more you discover what real catastrophic failure is.\n\n### Real catastrophic failure\n\nOkay, so you are a product pro and you know that this is a real disaster. You\nstill need to bring it to your product owner's attention. If you understand\nthe impact, you may offer guidance.\n\nAt corporates you may find a list of teams that need to be informed. Figure out\nwho and let them know. Never forget to include the operations team that manages\nescalations from call centers.\n\nBy proactively creating awareness, you eliminate everyone coming directly to you\nto tell you that something is broken in production.\n\nIf you have a change control framework, this is when you follow the emergency\nchange protocols.\n\n### You made a mistake\n\nWhen you make a mistake, don't go pointing fingers. You are human. Allow yourself\nto be one. You **will** make mistakes. It's fine - as long as you learn from them\nand nobody dies.\n\nLet the product owner know and be honest about it. If you hide it, expectations\ncannot be managed and someone will get into trouble.\n\nIf the team makes a mistake, you are part of it. You are one unit -\nthat should be solid. Make time to reflect on these mistakes (retrospectives)\nand find ways to improve (inspect and adapt) both personally and as a team.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nDistractions are a glorious pain in the backside. One of the worst distractions\nis consistently being asked for status updates. This is alleviated when we -\nsay it with me - manage expectations.\n\nI was terrible at this. When I eventually took action, I gained\na lot of trust from business. In turn, they gained my trust. Our interests\nare now aligned.\n\nI don't get asked for updates because I keep business informed.\nWe guide and help each other out. We have a healthy, strong and blissful\nrelationship.\n",

Teaming up with testers from the\n> beginning of a feature can positively impact the quality of the feature\n> being developed.\n\nAt work we often get trapped in our roles. We develop the software so we should\nonly contribute to the development of whatever we're building.\nOnce complete, someone - hopefully not the user - should test it. We\n[suck at testing](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2016/04/20/developers-poor-testers-can-done/)\nanyway don't we?\n\nPerhaps. I guess it depends. I don't particularly have \"parental feelings\"\ntowards my code. I love coding but I make mistakes. I can't think of all\npossible scenarios. I am aware of this. Today I write code and think it's\nthe most beautiful code I've ever written.\nSome time in the future I am guaranteed to pull my hair out. I've made peace\nwith it.\n\n> I've worked on codebases alone for most of my career. I know the sense of\n> autonomy it presents but I am also well aware of the problems it can cause.\n> Now that I am part of a team, I can produce better quality code because I\n> have more validation from others through brainstorms, discussions, code reviews,\n> CI and testing. I have more input.\n\nThe factory line of progressing a feature from UX to design to development to\nQA to DevOps into production feels very \"pushy\" to me. Sure it is the natural line\nof progression but we shouldn't just dump it onto the next stage. A deeper\nunderstanding of the **purpose** of the feature is definitely desirable.\n\n## Reaching the testing stage\n\nLet's focus on development to QA. Quality assurance is something that\nshouldn't be an after-thought therefore I'm going to refer to this stage as\n**testing** instead of QA. _(This is a more favorable term I've picked up\nthrough many craftsman in our industry)_\n\n### Understanding the feature\n\nImagine a feature submitted for testing where the tester doesn't understand the\nfeature entirely. The feature is tested subjectively, goes to production and its a\ndisaster. Or it goes back to development because it failed. Perhaps the tester\nwasn't aware of something critical to the feature.\n\nDoes this make them bad testers? I don't think so. I think it's just an error in\ncommunication.\n\nIt could be that the preferred method of communication is through email or\ndigital boards. I feel that text is great for audit trails and refreshing your\nmemory of something but it is subjective. When I read something I build a\npicture in my mind. That picture may look completely different to someone else.\nIn practice, talking to one another can help iron out those kinks in understanding.\n\nIf the testers are in the same vicinity as you, what stops you from\nhaving a conversation with them? If you are working remotely, you could\nhave VoIP call.\n\n### Not always very technical\n\nMost people won't say out of the blue, \"hey, I am not a technical person\"\nso the level of technical skills shouldn't be assumed. Technical issues -\nnetwork connectivity, proxy-related, authentication problems, environment\nconfiguration misalignment, etc. - could cause terrible impediments for testers.\n\nIf you are technical, why not step in an lend a helping hand? Encourage your\nteam to raise issues before stand-ups the next day. You don't have to take on\neverything yourself but you could be a gateway to roping in the right people\nfor the job. Show your tester how you are resolving it so that he/she can learn\nand upskill in that space.\n\n### User-focused\n\nTesters try to understand how users interact with systems. Depending\non the audience, this could be completely different to how a developer interacts\nwith a system. If you are very technical and logical, what you create may make\nsense to you. That doesn't mean that your users will understand it.\n\nYou could learn a lot about testing and how users interact with what you build\nwhen you partner up with your tester.\n\n### Use-cases\n\nAs testers are user-focused, they think up different use cases to test features\nagainst. If a feature fails any of these cases, it needs to be fixed before\nit can progress. This is valuable knowledge that we should consider upfront.\n\nThis could help us understand what will be tested so that we can ensure we cater\nfor such cases. It's less expensive as stories have a lower chance of hopping\nback and forth within a sprint.\n\n### Automated tests\n\nTesters these days rely on testing our systems by executing automated regression\nand functional test suites. This involves code. Perhaps we can help out here.\nThis could provide a great platform to learn new tools and share knowledge and ideas.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with pair programming with a tester.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nThe team is responsible for quality and delivery of software - not you alone.\nYou may not have control over the entire eco-system but you do have\ncontrol over the quality of the code going into the repository. How much do you\nvalue quality?\n\nYou can't do everything alone. You need to work cohesively as a team.\n\n> [Oz Chihwayi](https://twitter.com/ozchihwayi) and\n> [Janco Wolmarans](https://twitter.com/jancowol) presented together at\n> [DeveloperUG](http://www.meetup.com/DeveloperUG/)\n> (a local meetup) one night. Their talk was titled **\"The story of a Tester and a\n> Developer\"**. This story really resonated with me as it touched on a lot of\n> concepts I had to figure out the hard way.\n",

Only you can truly know what\n> is going on inside your mind. Communicating with context and intent\n> helps alleviate confusing discussions.\n\nOur minds are beautiful. It processes, sorts and catalogs data from each\nexperience and outputs a perspective. From this we create an understanding of\nsomething which allows us to draw conclusions. The\nperspectives we have aren't rigid; they evolve over time.\nWe don't all experience things the same so we could conclude that our\nperspectives are subjective to our understanding of experiences.\n\nKnowing this, we need to be mindful of how we initiate our conversations. Looking\nat queries in particular, it's often a struggle to get people on the same page\nas you.\n\n## The nature of queries\n\nWhen we have a query, we need help or guidance from someone else. Much like\n`T-SQL` it needs to be declarative to get results. If we omit an important part\nof the `T-SQL` statement, our results are skewed.\n\n## Declaring context\n\nPeople are complicated and there are many obstacles when it comes to conversing.\nIn code we aim to communicate intent. Let's try apply that to the structure of\nour queries:\n\n-   Introduction - Who are you?\n-   The nature of the query - What the query is about?\n-   The actual query - Why are you asking for help?\n-   Conclusion\n\n### Introduction\n\nIntroductions are important. The let people know who you are and help\nbuild relationships. It's a good start to introduce yourself.\nBy building relationships with others, both parties are able to get assistance\nfaster in the future.\n\n#### Give your name\n\nIf you don't know someone, provide your name. You can do this until a relationship\nis formed.\n\n#### Tell the person where you are from\n\nSome people are exposed to queries from many different spaces.\nBy providing information like your company, division and team, people know\nwhere you are coming from which gives a better understanding to the nature of\nyour query. What you provide depends on who you talk to and where\nthat person is from:\n\n![alt text](/svg/context_where-you-are-from.svg \"Flow chart for deciding how to communicate where you are from\")\n\n**Note:** If you are a consultant from a different company, keep it simple by\nomitting your company's name unless it is related to your query.\n\n#### Tell the person what you do\n\nBy providing your role, people have a better understanding of the nature of\nyour query (provided it is related). They also have a better\nunderstanding of what role you play within your team and the organization.\n\nIf people already know what you do, you don't have to keep repeating this unless\nyour role changes.\n\n> **Example:**<br/>Hi, my name is Clarice, a software developer from the\n> DStv Now website team.\n\nYou don't have to add fancy titles like senior or junior. The point is not to\nclassify the level in your role but rather to categorize what you do. Developers\ndon't always have the same types of queries as designers for instance.\n\nIf you don't feel like your role will be adding value or if you are asking on\nbehalf of someone in a different role. You could omit it and move the introduction to add\ncontext for the other role.\n\n> **Example:**<br/>Hi, my name is Clarice from the DStv Now website team.\n> I'm coming to you on behalf of Alexa, a designer in our team.\n\n### The nature of the query\n\nTell the person what your query is about. Try to be specific so that the person\ncan decide if he/she can actually help you. If someone referred you to this\nperson, mention this.\n\nThis gives people the opportunity to determine if they can help you. If they\ncan't, they may refer you to someone they think has more expertise.\n\nCommunicate to the person that they can stop you at any time to ask for more\ncontext. This could plant a seed that causes awareness for over-whelming\nparts of the query.\n\n> **Example:**<br/> I need technical assistance with Jenkins. Sarah thinks you can help me\n> so she referred me to you. Please stop me at any time if you need more context.\n\n### The actual query\n\nThis is the meat of your query. Get down to the specifics of what you\nneed help with. You can also give points of what you have already tried,\nwho you have spoken to and why you are coming to this person for guidance.\n\n> **Example:**<br/> I am configuring Jenkins and would like to understand how I can\n> give developers outside of our team access to view our pipelines. IT is concurrently\n> investigating internet problems I'm having so to save time, I came to you.\n> Do you think you could help me?\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDecide if the query is resolved. If it isn't and the person can't offer\nadditional assistance, ask if you can be referred to someone else. If not,\nask around - continuously providing context - until you hit the jackpot.\n\nRemember that this person has taken time out of their schedule to help you. Be\ngrateful.\n\n> **Example:**<br/> Thanks. You've helped a great deal. I really appreciate it.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nThis sounds so simple when laid out but in practice we take our own perspectives,\ncircumstances and environments for granted.\n\nWe can't assume that people always know what we know. We need to give context: in our\nteams, across teams, across divisions and across companies. Context is something\nthat we can easily overlook.\n\nPay attention to the person's body language. This may indicate that you are\noverwhelming them.\n\nTo get better results for your queries, provide the necessary context.\n",

I feel this way sometimes. It is\n> exhausting. How can we find ways to feel fulfilled and accomplished at the\n> end of the day?\n\nRushed days leave me feeling exhausted. Today was one of those days. Events\nwere back-to-back. Emails and instant messages were streaming in. There was\nlittle time to breathe.\n\nHave I fallen victim to \"[rush hour syndrome](http://smartblogs.com/leadership/2014/05/19/the-rush-syndrome-how-it-affects-your-health-and-your-job/)\"?\n\nWhen days get filled to the brim with noise and tasks that cannot be completed,\nhow can we not feel exhausted and unaccomplished? Surely this can't be healthy.\n\n-   **It's affected my memory**: And not in a good way. My memory gets worse\n    when I'm doing too many things at once. Stand-ups are challenging as I struggle\n    to recall the mixture of interlaced tasks that I juggled the day before.\n\n-   **Quality suffers**: If I can't focus on something and do that well, the\n    quality will take a knock. Constant context-switching and multi-tasking\n    are a real threat.\n\n-   **Expectations aren't met**: If I am too busy I struggle to get round to\n    [managing expectations](/blog/manage-expectations). If business is expecting\n    something but there is something else keeping me busy, they need to be aware of\n    it.\n\n-   **TODOs spiraling out of control**: Production bugs, changes, queries, issues,\n    improvements, suggestions... the list just grows. It feels like a mountain\n    growing on my back.\n\n## What went wrong?\n\nSome days I am very good at tackling things. Today I felt like an imposter.\nI felt like I had no idea of what I was doing and all my improvements went out\nthe window. Everything felt like a mammoth task that\ncouldn't easily be completed. How did I get here?\n\n### Taking on too much\n\nI am overburdened this month - both in my personal and professional\ncapacity. I've committed to too much. Much like a sprint, I need to cut down\nmy commitments to manageable chunks which alleviates pressure. Challenging\nmyself is good but spreading myself thinly causes exhaustion.\n\n### Less time for myself\n\nBy taking on too much I have little time to breathe. I need to make time to\nmeditate again. This helped align my mental being with the physical world.\nI do Pilates and Yoga twice a week and am in a better state of mind afterwards.\n\n### Playing other roles\n\nI have eight years of experience being a one person team. If something needs to\nbe done I am naturally able to complete it, regardless of the role required.\nThis doesn't go down well in a corporate as I can't possibly do everything\non my own. Sometimes I forget this.\n\nIf I have an impediment, I usually sort it out myself. This eats into the time\nfor the work that I have committed to completing. Depending on the nature of\nthe impediment, sometimes I need a friendly reminder from a Scrum Master to say,\n\"Hey you, I am here. Let me help you.\"\n\n### I stopped documenting \"task creep\"\n\nI had a great conversation with my Product Owner one day about how I was\nstruggling to keep track of all sorts of tasks that crept into a sprint. She\nsuggested keeping a journal. It helped with remembering what kept me busy\nduring the day. I could also raise flags that could improve our process and\nescalation procedures.\n\nWhen I'm overwhelmed, writing things down feels like it's adding to the things\nI need to do, so I slipped out of it. This was a mistake.\n\n### Not asking for help\n\nI had a list of things I needed to do but wasn't finding time in the sprint to\ndo them. I raised this with the team. They gladly offered to pick up a task\nand help out where they could as it affected our team and product.\n\n### Being hard on myself\n\nThese are all bad habits that I am trying to improve on. Like any habit it is\nhard to unlearn overnight. When I feel overwhelmed, the habits are triggered\nand I am back to square one. Instead of feeling like an imposter, I should just\nacknowledge that I am having an off day and get assistance where I can.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nBy being aware of my flaws I am able to actively improve on them. It may not go\nas well as expected each day but that's okay. Being hard on myself isn't going\nto help me.\n\nTrusting in a team and working in an environment where you are granted the\nopportunity to continuously learn and improve is something I can leverage on.\n\nFor now some days may be rushing by but who knows what the future will hold if I\nkeep on improving?\n\n> If you have experienced this or have found ways to improve your day, please\n> share in the comments below. It is a great way to learn through the experience\n> of others.\n",

There are a\nlot of people involved and possibly a plethora of reasons for why they do things\nthe way they do - that I can't see right now.\n\nIt doesn't mean that I have to always agree with every decision that is made.\nJust because it's always been done that way, doesn't mean it can't be changed.\nRight?\n\nI know people working at corporates are doing the best that they can and that\nthings can get pretty messy when a lot of people are involved. Some things\nend up cumbersome and bloated or go completely overlooked. Here's what I\nwould focus on to make a happier space for developers.\n\n## Solid onboarding process\n\nWhen a developer starts at a corporate, they are going to be overwhelmed. This\nis guaranteed. It doesn't matter how many years experience they have, they need\nto learn everything about the business, products and the people from the ground\nup. This takes a [lot of time](/blog/time-is-precious).\n\nWe shouldn't just throw people into the deep end with everything. \"Bend a tree\nwhile it is still growing.\"\n\n-   Give them a solid welcome pack with important HR and company familiarity\n    documents. It should act like a map with a \"you are here\" in this business.\n\n-   Access cards, user accounts and all technical requirements need to be available\n    on the start date. Someone joining a company is eager and excited. Idle time\n    is going to be frustrating.\n\n-   Orientation needs to be ongoing for a few months. One day is too overwhelming\n    in large companies and not everyone is going to retain all that knowledge that\n    is crammed into their minds.\n\n-   Assign a mentor for the next year so they have a dedicated person to guide and\n    help them along.\n\n-   Don't assign them to a team straight away. Sure you may desperately need\n    professionals in some teams but this is only going to slow down the delivery and cause\n    unnecessary frustrations within a team.\n\n-   Instead let them join a team of their choice and pair on bite-sized chunks of\n    work. Perhaps they could be rotated every sprint up to about four sprints.\n    This should be less invasive and give them more exposure to teams, products,\n    people and technology. By pairing, they don't have the pressures of setting up\n    their environments fully but as they have their machines they can start\n    exploring codebases and read up where they can.\n\n-   After the rotation period is up, let the person choose from a list of priority\n    teams - teams who need developers. Let the team have an informal interview\n    with the candidate to identify a possible fit. Forced placements don't\n    encourage a sense of autonomy within the team and if the person doesn't fit\n    well in the team, everyone is left discouraged.\n\n## Focus on staff retention\n\nThe customer is very important but without your staff there will be no customer.\nI would get my managers to focus on keeping their staff happy while the staff\ncan focus on keeping the customers happy.\n\nIf someone is frustrated in a team and it cannot be resolved, perhaps they are\nnot suited for the team. If the person needs to be relocated, I'd have a\nconversation with the team to find out who they think will be better suited for\ntheir team.\n\n## Adjust the pay scale\n\nMarket-related salaries pay the person what other companies are willing to pay.\nWhat is the person worth to the company? If creative minds are constantly\nworried about money, quality will suffer and the person will eventually\nleave the company.\n\nI don't think slapping everyone with fat salaries is the answer but people need\nto be happy with what they are earning so that they don't look for\nopportunities elsewhere.\n\n## Adjust KPIs\n\nIf the pay scale is right money is not an issue. Bonuses are great but if they\nare driving poor decisions or cannot be met then why do we offer a reward?\nValue is more important and how it is measured is up to the division and\nrole I guess. Isn't it better to receive a bonus based on the value you add to\nthe company within your role?\n\nMoney aside, people want to grow in their craft. Perhaps offering a reward to\ngo to popular conferences local and abroad to upskill and network could be an\nincentive. Arranging a workshop with \"developer celebrities\" could be another.\n\n## Encourage autonomy\n\nNot only should it be encouraged but allow it to be practiced. Managers can\nprovide guidance and business direction but the product teams as a whole\nshould be able to make decisions. They need to talk to the right people and\nteams so that everything aligns to the bigger picture.\n\nBy have autonomous teams, management can focus on managing and alleviates\ndecision making bottlenecks that can be faced.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nMaybe this will all result in failure. Who knows? I've only been at a\ncorporate for two years now and perhaps I am being ambitious or over-looking\nsomething. I do feel that there is a mindset from very high up in the corporate\nchain that needs to be aligned with the advances in the technology space.\nWhatever that adjustment is, I can still speculate.\n",

Or take a peaceful walk\n> without having to rush for something?\n\nToday I sat in standstill traffic. It took me an hour to get home. It's usually\nbetween 15 and 20 minutes. My time is precious to me so I was frustrated. I'm in\nthis \"get up and go\" mindset where every second counts.\n\nI frantically waited for [Waze](https://www.waze.com/) and my network\nprovider to cooperate. I needed a route recalculation and I needed it fast.\nWe were standing still for long. Not to mention the fact that I left work\nwithout going to the loo.\n\nLucky for me, the app calculated a route and got me home within the hour. Who\nknows how long I would have been stuck in that dreadful traffic?\n\nBefore I rerouted, many drivers became reckless. The rules of the road were\ndiscarded. I guess this is due to frustration and desperation. Other drivers\nbecame annoyed and vocal.\nThere was no more room for courtesy as people were pushing in one after\nthe other.\n\nA metaphor hit me like a [pan galactic gargle blaster](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Pan_Galactic_Gargle_Blaster).\nWe experience chaos like this in software development teams. When pressure\nbuilds some people throw process out of the window. Others get mad about that.\nPeople act out of frustration and desperation.\n\n## Organized chaos\n\nA bunch of people with different types of skills, perspectives, personalities\nand traits are thrown into a team and are expected to produce quality output\nupon request. This is sometimes done in a confined space like a **war room**.\n\nPeople experience pressure differently. Some run-away, some get frustrated,\nsome panic while some are completely chilled.\n\nI want to dive into time-related factors that add pressure to teams.\nWhile teams produce results, quality can suffer as a result of such factors.\nThis leads to an array of different emotions within a team.\n\n### Ramp-up time\n\nWhen someone joins the team for the first time, there is a ramp-up period.\nRamp-ups take time and can create a burden on the rest of the team especially\nif it is a pressure cooker environment.\n\n#### Onboarding process\n\nWhen a person joins a company, they need to learn everything from the ground\nup: business, products, teams, network, unfamiliar technologies,\ndebugging the solution, endpoints, processes, policies and people. It can take\nmonths to settle in especially if a person is coming from a small to medium\ncompany.\n\nIf this person isn't properly mentored or receives proper and ongoing\norientation, what becomes of them? I guess it depends on the nature of the team.\nIf the team is always pressed for time, how are they going to properly ramp\nthat person up? This poor person is going to be overwhelmed and pick up some\nbad habits.\n\n#### Resignations\n\nWhen someone resigns, all the knowledge that person has acquired leaves with them.\nAlthough everyone is replaceable and policies can be in place to alleviate pain,\nit still has a social impact on the team. Not to mention a replacement is required\nto alleviate pressure from the rest of the team.\n\n#### Relocations\n\nI like the idea of being able to move to different teams. This exposes you to\nother parts of the business. However, there is a trade-off on both teams.\n\nAs the person is already accustomed to the company, the ramp-up time should\njust be for the solution and process within the team. Depending on the\ncomplexity, this can take some time. What happens when there isn't a replacement\nin the other team?\n\n### People need time to gel\n\nIt takes some time for a team to start gelling well and learn that they can\ndepend on one another. Trust isn't something that happens implicitly -\nespecially if one has experienced problems in the past. This can slow things\ndown and frustrate people who want to get things done.\n\nDisruptions, like relocations and resignations, can affect the team dynamics\nespecially if the team finds out last minute or has no say regarding the\nrelocation.\n\n### Not seeing the bigger picture\n\nLet's say business indicates a sense of urgency on a feature. The team starts\nworking on it. Then business decides that the priority has changed.\nThe feature is discarded or put on ice.\n\nWho likes working on features that don't go into production? This can be super\nfrustrating and cause complexity in the repository when put on ice.\n\nBusiness needs to communicate the importance of the decision. Don't settle for the\n\"because my boss said so\" answer - there must be a real reason. When I find myself in\nthis situation, I find myself less frustrated after I have found out why.\n\nLucky for us we have a Product Owner that communicates intent with us.\nIf you don't have someone like that, perhaps you could aspire to being nosy\nand finding out for yourself. Don't hold onto that knowledge - share it with\nyour team.\n\n### Pop-up meetings eat into productivity\n\nI work in an Agile team with a two week sprint. We have ceremonies that leave us\nwith about 8 ½ days of actual work time. Meetings that pop up during the sprint that\ndon't necessarily relate to the current sprint work make me very anxious.\n\n#### Don't attend everything\n\nI used to feel obligated to attend every meeting I was invited to. I have come to\nrealize that in most cases, people are just trying to get people into a room to\ntalk about a finding a solution to a problem. I try to find out more about the meeting\nto see if I can add value. If I can't I simply decline - and say why.\nIf there is someone more knowledgeable I suggest they get in touch with that person.\n\n#### Meetings need direction\n\nIf there is no direction then what is the point of the meeting? Politely\nexcuse yourself.\n\n> I recently attended a meeting directed by our Product Owner. It was the\n> best meeting ever. She managed to get people of all divisions to\n> communicate how one thing was being handled. She took charge of the meeting, got\n> the right people to talk to each other and we got to understand the entire\n> end-to-end process **in the allocated time**. I wish all meetings were like that.\n\n#### Time-boxing\n\nI've evolved from the archaic developer mindset into a people-driven realm.\nPeople fascinate me. Unfortunately I now lose track of time in meetings and\noffice conversations which paradoxically means I waste precious productivity\ntime - which is precious to me.\n\nTime-boxing is essential to keep on track with commitments. When a meeting is\nrunning over its allocated time and you are no longer obligated to be there, is there\nany harm in excusing yourself?\n\n## My final thoughts\n\n1.  The \"get up and go\" mindset is exhausting and is something I want to move away\n    from. Rushing about to stay on top of things really impacts quality of work.\n\n    It also makes me feel conflicted during idle-time. No wonder\n    my days are [rushing by me](/blog/days-that-rush-away).\n\n    When last did I just stop to smell a flower? Or take a peaceful walk without\n    having to rush for something?\n\n2.  If I feel pressure I can talk to my manager and business to find ways to\n    alleviate the pressure. If I keep it to myself, people think that everything is\n    okay in my world.\n\n3.  The corporate world is tricky. There are many ups and downs. Many things are out\n    of my control. One thing I can control is how I spend my time.\n",

Changing it is\nscary. I don't always trust the test suites attached to codebases because\nwith time and neglect, code and tests can rot. I do rely on them though.\n\nThe alternative to the monolith - microservices. It's become a buzz word.\nHave services that do one thing and do it well. A separation of concerns when\nit comes to the architecture of applications.\n\nYes! I am in, but wait... are we fully equipped to go down this path?\n\n## Analysis paralysis\n\nWhat if you could break your existing service down into 50 services. Another\nperson on your team only identifies 5 services. The dev lead sees 10. I don't\nknow if this exact scenario often happens but:\n\n-   How do you go about splitting them?\n-   Will you be able to communicate the benefits of splitting them to business?\n-   How does splitting your current services impact your consumers?\n\n## Time constraints\n\nIt takes time to set up each service:\n\n-   Create the code base\n-   Configure version control\n-   Configure dependencies\n-   Set up scaffolding\n-   Write the logic\n-   Add useful logging\n-   Configure environments\n-   Setup continuous integration and deployment pipelines\n-   Create an automated test suite\n-   Documentation\n\nIf you need to quickly produce a prototype or minimum viable product, you will\nmost likely skip this. Unfortunately the reality is that many prototypes\nand MVPs end up in production - for life. I suppose this is how an app becomes\na monolith. If time is allocated to refactor and rework the architecture\niteratively it could be saved.\n\n## Monolithic architecture\n\nWe are trading off a monolithic application for monolithic architecture. If\nthere isn't an overview (diagram or documentation) it can be hard to find\nthe source code and endpoints for each service - especially if the naming\nconvention is that of Marvel superheroes (I've not personally seen this but\ndevelopers can be quite creative).\n\nLuckily the services need to be configured to talk to other services so endpoints\ncan be discovered once you have the source.\n\n## Unpredictable environments\n\nThere can be a number of environments that need to be configured like\nLocalhost, Development, QA, Staging and Production.\n\nOne would assume that environments would be aligned for each dependency. If I\npoint to the QA `Billing` service, it would point to the QA `Accounts`\nservice.\n\nThis is not always the case. Each team has its own constraints and\nreasons for pointing to different environments - especially if their dependencies\nare external. Oh boy, how much pain this can cause\n\n## Bloated configurations\n\nConfigurations become bloated with endpoints and each environment needs to be\nconfigured accordingly. This isn't too bad unless you are the consumer\nusing a lot of dependencies.\n\n## Identifying bugs\n\nBugs are hard to pin-point if there are no tests validating different\nintegration points.\n\n### Unstable data\n\nData can become unpredictable the lower the level of the environment especially\nacross different teams. Strange and unpredictable behavior can cause skewed\nresults during testing. Developers end up spending valuable time chasing down\nwhere things went wrong.\n\n### Poor logging\n\nIt is \"fairly easy\" to debug monolithic applications (provided you can get it\nrunning) because you can step into the code. When it comes to microservices,\nthe proof is in the logging.\n\nSadly, logging is sometimes an after thought. This makes it hard to\nidentify problems in the stack.\n\n**Events need to be chained**. If you trigger an event, you need to be able to\ntrack that event right through the stack in some form of visible logging\nsolution like [GrayLog](https://www.graylog.org).\n\n## Getting buy-in\n\nNot everyone believes that microservices are the solution. Every solution\nhas trade-offs. When designing the architecture it is important to consider the\nadvantages and disadvantages. The debates should be knowledgeable. I think it's\na terrible idea to consider implementing something just because everyone else is\ndoing it. That's resume-driven development - avoid it.\n\nThe team needs to support the application so they are responsible for the\ndecisions they make. It is important to consider what negative impact a\ndecision can have. Perhaps that could be the driving factor to deciding?\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nI am not opposed to microservices. What I am opposed to is struggling\nto get features tested due to unpredictable data and unstable environments.\n\nOften tremendous pain is felt in the front-end consumer teams. Valuable time\nis wasted trying to sift through a plethora of services and meaningless logs\nto try pin-point exactly where stuff broke.\n\nIf the company and teams don't have the right mindset or environment,\nmicroservices aren't necessarily the answer. What I've discussed highlights\nsymptoms of different problems within teams and organizations that would have\nan impact on a microservices architecture.\n\nIf this approach is taken, I believe that teams need:\n\n-   Efficient and reliable continuous delivery pipelines ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/))\n-   Visibility to [monitoring](https://www.paessler.com/prtg) of services\n-   Overview [diagrams](https://trace.risingstack.com) and/or documentation of\n    the architecture\n-   Useful integration tests\n-   Stable and predictable environments\n-   Visible, useful and chained logs\n\n> Please share your experiences in the comments below.\n\n* * *\n\nWant to find out more about microservices?\n\n-   [How Enterprises Benefit From Microservices Architectures](https://blog.risingstack.com/how-enterprises-benefit-from-microservices-architectures/)\n-   [Microservice Trade-Offs](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html)\n-   [Pattern: Microservices Architecture](http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html)\n-   [Microservices architecture: advantages and drawbacks](http://cloudacademy.com/blog/microservices-architecture-challenge-advantage-drawback/)\n-   [The Benefits Of Microservices](http://sendachi.com/2016/microservices/the-benefits-of-microservices)\n",

Do you have one? What\n> benefits have you observed?\n\nI started this blog as a [course](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/).\nI decided to meticulously create the site from scratch keeping in mind page\nspeed and user experience.\n\nIt took a lot more time and dedication from me. I had to create features from\nscratch instead of using a CMS and existing design template.\nAs a back-end developer with a love for front-end, this approach was way more\nexciting for me. I could dive deep into a feature, understand its benefits and\ndecide if it was really worth adding it.\n\n## Personal benefits\n\n### I have direction\n\nI like writing code in my spare time. I often find myself writing code that\ngoes nowhere. I tend to over think and over complicate it. This is usually\nbecause I don't have a clear direction to focus on. By creating something with\ndirection, I have a goal and it is fulfilling to see the \"product\" materialize.\n\n### Exposure to iterative development\n\nBy having to create all the features from scratch, I need to take an iterative\napproach. It's like running my own little Agile project. This is very exciting\nas I need to put different types of hats on during development. I have to\nswitch between a user, product owner, designer and developer.\n\nI release iteratively at my own schedule. This exposes me to the problems\nbusiness may face if an important feature is introduced. It's a fun exercise.\n\n### Autonomy feels good\n\nBy having full autonomy on my pet project I can do as I please. This is\nexciting as you are working on your own product and make your own decisions.\nIt boosts creativity, allows you to experiment and helps find solutions to\nproblems that you can apply at work.\n\n## Productivity benefits at work\n\n### Knowledge can be applied\n\nIt may not help my role directly but it can have a positive impact on the team.\nI can liaise with front-end developers, help with grunt tasks & SASS, improve page\nspeed and work closer with designers.\n\n### Confidence is boosted\n\nI started telling people about the site at work. This is something that is\noutside my comfort zone. I like making things, then keeping it to myself or\nchucking it because I am scared of the feedback.\n\nAll that went out of the window when I launched **{{ site.title }}**. I just\nstarted telling everyone I could. I linked it to my online profiles.\nI share my articles.\n\nThis may freak me out but it has boosted my confidence a lot.\n\n### Dabble in different tech\n\nAs a corporate developer you tend to get \"boxed\" into a role within a team. It's not\nalways easy to be cross-functional even if it comes naturally to you. You need\nto build trust and what better way than create your own work of art that you\ncan share and be proud of.\n\nI started my journey with [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) and\n[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I was so ecstatic when the designers at work\nsaid the design was beautiful!\n\nI was also able to get my hands dirty with node, ruby, analytics, optimization\nand different types of automation in the front-end space.\n\n> Check out the [credits](/credits) page that lists what went into making this\n> site.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nHaving a pet project can be beneficial to upskill, boost confidence and think\noutside your role. It also provides an opportunity for you to create something\nthat you can be proud of which can showcase your skills.\n\nBy letting your creative juices flow outside of your work environment, you can\npositively influence your productivity at work - provided you don't let it\nburn you out.\n",

It's not\na new (I Googled it) but it is new to me.\n\nAs a software developer I naturally felt obligated to write about code and\ntechnical implementations. I didn't follow through on that. To me, writing code\nis a small subset of software development.\n\nWe write software for a reason. What that reason is depends on the people who\nwill be using that software. I have a lot of fun writing code but I have more\nfun making software with people for people.\n\nThere are interesting challenges that materialize when people start working\ntogether. Especially so when there is a lot of\n[unnecessary complicatedness](#side-note) in an\norganizational structure. We all want different things for different reasons\nwith our own ideas, past experiences and understandings. Tackling these\nchallenges to make for better software, delivery and happier teams & users is\nwhat I love thinking about. This is the crux of what I want to write about.\n\nThe people we make software with are the:\n\n## User\n\nWe can argue about the best technologies and implementations to use then write\ncode everyday until we turn into code writing zombies. What is the point if\npeople don't like it or even worse, don't want to use it?\n\nTo me, truly understanding the significance of the problem being solved and\nexactly who it is for is a fundamental part of creating software. I want to\nrelate on a social level and almost \"feel\" the impact it will have on the users.\n\n## UX & Design\n\nThis step is often abstracted away from developers but lucky for me, we\nall sit in the same room.\n\nI like to know why decisions are made so that I can paint the bigger picture\nin my mind. This communication is a two-way street of insight into the user,\nthe strategy, consistency throughout products and the technology.\n\n## Developers\n\nWriting code for a computer to understand is easy. Writing code for humans is\na challenge. Many [software craftsman](#software-craftsmanship) save the day with insights\nto write clean, testable and maintainable code.\n\n<small>I don't advocate \"Fear-Driven Development\" but this tweet is both funny and\ntrue on some level:</small>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Write code as if the next maintainer is a vicious psychopath who knows where you live.&quot;</p>&mdash; Jack Franklin (@Jack_Franklin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin/status/275921461661822976\">December 4, 2012</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nRegardless of the process, patterns and practices that we choose, we should not\nforget what is important: writing code that can be understood and changed to\nhave a continuous delivery stream that produces value. How we do it is up to us\nbut we need to take responsibility and think ahead.\n\nWhen you make a mistake, keep this in mind:\n\n> Blame is not for failure, it is for failing to help or ask for help.<br/>\n> ~ Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, The CEO of the Lego Group\n\n## Testers\n\nTesters take your work and rip it apart. They look for flaws, loopholes and\nissues that may arise while a user is interacting with your software.\n\nThis is a good thing. For 8 years I didn't have a safety net. I know that I\nam human and make mistakes. And I did.\n\nI believe [communicating with testers](/blog/bonding-with-testers/)\nis essential to understanding how something is tested and what could cause a\nfeature to fail in this verification step.\n\n## Business\n\nBusiness can be the entity, stakeholders, clients, customers and even our users.\nUnderstanding the financial and strategic impact the software has on business\nis important to me. It helps with the bigger picture.\n\nBehind the term business are people we can talk to and engage with.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nIt's easy to get strung up in complicatedness that we fail to remember why we\nstarted writing code in the first place.\n\nBy understanding what other people do and the decisions they make I have a\nbetter understanding of the code I need to write and the impact it has on our\nusers. I never want to lose sight of my goal: **making software for people\nwith people** and having fun while doing so. To me, this is what people\noriented software is about.\n\n### Side note:\n\nSometimes it's not easy to communicate and engage throughout the SDLC\ndue to certain organizational structures. Structures and rules\nthat govern such environments make for unnecessary complications,\nclunky processes, bottlenecks, back-and-forth and disengaged employees.\n\nThis is a different challenge but if you want to see **Yves Morieux**\ntalk about simplifying this, check out his brilliant\n[TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/yves_morieux_as_work_gets_more_complex_6_rules_to_simplify)\ntitled \"**As work gets more complex, 6 rules to simplify**.\"\n\n* * *\n\n<a id=\"software-craftsmanship\"></a>\nSome technical resources for software craftsmanship:\n\n-   [Code Complete](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670):\n    A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition 2nd Edition\n-   The Robert C.

If it's not\n> breaking you down, it's not building you up.\" quoted by Scott Hanselman\n\nThe comfort zone. What a wonderful place. It's so safe to be in. You're\nfamiliar with the surroundings, it has few surprises and everything just makes\nsense.\n\nI love it but I am never in it long enough to sit back and put my feet up\nwith a bowl of popcorn.\n\nI keep pushing my limits both personally and professionally. At times I may\n**strongly dislike** what I am doing but after the fact I think to myself \"WOW,\nI just did that!\" It's very rewarding.\n\nAs a developer I can relate to how awkward networking and socializing can be. This\nis even harder when you lack self-confidence. Here are the top three things\nI've done that have helped me build some social confidence.\n\n## Start conversations\n\nWhen I experienced issues with whatever technology or process, I'd strike up a\nconversation with someone higher up than me. I'd ask questions and try\nbrainstorm with them.\n\nIn the beginning I was so freaked out by simply talking to them that I'd instantly\nblush. So hard in fact that I'd feel my face burn. I ended up being so self-conscious that\nI couldn't hear what they had to say. It was worse when I didn't know\nthe person at all.\n\nBlogging and tweeting was scary for me too but it also helps start conversations.\nYou put an idea out there and if you're lucky, people start engaging which\ncan either validate your idea or expose you to a new mindset.\n\nBy persisting through the fear, I've built some confidence and learned a lot of\ncool insights from others. I've also been able to engage with some influential\nsoftware developers - something the old me would never have done.\nThe more you do it, the less scary it becomes.\n\n## Attend events with friends\n\nI feel more comfortable to sit back and absorb information without engaging\nwith _strangers_ at an event. I'm shy and self-conscious. But now, I act a bit\ndifferently.\n\nI must admit that it's easier for me to strike up a conversation with someone\nI don't know when I'm with someone I do know. The more the merrier.\n\nI'd go to meetups or events with my husband (also a developer) or other dev\nbuddies and somehow feel _stronger_. This makes it easier for me to initiate\nconversations with the speaker or other developers at the event.\n\n**Tip**: The more you attend community events, the more familiar the people\naround you become.\n\n## Talk to strangers\n\nStart a conversation with a stranger. Elevators and queues are the easiest\nplace to start.\n\nSmiling makes you approachable and immediately uplifts a person's spirits\n(not always, but most times).\n\nGiving a true compliment is a great conversation starter and also has a\npositive impact on the other person. When in doubt, bring weather into the\nconversation.\n\nThis helps build confidence when talking to people you don't know which helps \nwhen you want to start networking at events or other social gatherings.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nI don't know how many software developers are self-conscious or lack\nself-confidence but I know many who are socially awkward.\n\nRandomly talking to people may not be something you want to do but why not\ngive it a try?\n\nEngaging with people exposes you to different mindsets and thought patterns.\nThis accelerates learning especially if you're new to something or just\nstarting out. It also helps you network and grow your professional\nreputation. With that comes a lot of career opportunity.\n\n> \"I think that we grow when we are outside our comfort zone.

I just value the quality of a\nworking environment and what I am working on more than the salary.\nOn the other spectrum, I hear of many people who put up with bad working\nconditions simply because of the money.\n\nUnfortunately the reality is that there will always be some form of pain or\ntrade-off that we need to deal with. Prove to me that there is a [company](blog/the-perfect-illusion/)\nto work for without any problems.\n\nProblems are different to each individual. We all have our own perspectives.\nThat means we are surrounded by people with different states or emotions\nwhether it be happy, comfortable, frustrated or completely disengaged.\nSadly it only takes one person with a sour mindset to bring an entire team\nto its knees.\n\nTo top it off, there are so many different ways of achieving the same thing.\nEverything has risk attached to it. When people become driven by fear,\nthe need for change stagnates. It's also overwhelming when so many technologies\nemerge and we constantly feel like we have fallen behind.\n\nWhen we find ourselves in such predicaments, what can we do to avoid\nspiraling down the same rabbit hole?\n\n**Remember the day you wrote your first applications!** That excitement you felt\nwhen you got your code to run even if it was just spaghetti. Bring that feeling\nback to the now and read on.\n\nHere are three things I've done to help spread that feeling.\n\n## Think like an entrepreneur\n\nI'm not an entrepreneur. I've been too scared to go down that path but I'd like\nto someday.\n\nIf I were one, I would need to make the best decisions to give me\nthe biggest return of investment in a short amount of time. I'd have the user's\nbest interests at heart. I'd also know that the people working with me will make\nthis a reality.\n\nI try to be cross-functional; do my best to help out where I can within my team\nand across teams.\n\nI'm not advocating working long hours, missing out on life and doing the work\nof others. Rather working together, being passionate, understanding the\nbusiness side of things and having the ability to\nmake appropriate trade-offs to deliver quality software to the market.\n\n## Share the passion\n\nIf we radiate a positive energy and share the passion we have for making quality\nsoftware and guide - **not force** - others to do the same it can become\ncontagious.\n\nLet's say someone is new to TDD and is told to write tests first.\nThey probably won't. It's more code; more effort. There are deadlines.\nIf someone is coached to see the benefits and understand how easy it can be,\nwith time the mindset changes and confidence is built.\n\nIn other words, people are used to doing things the way they feel comfortable\nwith. It's never a good idea to impose new ways of doing things on people.\nWe can gradually show how a technique can better productivity and\nreap more benefits.\n\nGrab opportunities to pair program with someone who is passionate and\npatient. If two people are just bickering about the smallest things pairing\nwon't achieve much. Empathy to a person's background and circumstances is\nimportant.\n\n## Talk to the right people\n\nMany developers are introverts. They won't always get up and speak to the right\npeople when something is getting in their way. They will keep trying to\nfix it on their own.\n\nBuilding strong relationships is essential to solving problems quicker\nespecially when there are dependencies that are outside of your control.\n\nI encourage people to talk to the right people. This is a great way to\nacquire new knowledge about the people in the company, domain, infrastructure\nand technologies. If they don't know how, I do it with them.\n\nThis builds confidence and exposes us to other people. We get introduced to\nother passionate professionals that we can learn from.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nPassion is the basic building block of my career. I never want to lose it - but\nI did.\n\nThe transition from smaller companies to larger companies was tough on me.\nI got so caught up in my craft that I lost my confidence and the fun of\nactually writing code. I was also overwhelmed by everyone's opinions\nwhich often contradicted each other.\n\nWhen we work at corporates we are exposed to all sorts of people from all\nwalks of life. We aren't aware of their past experiences. People will lose\ntheir passion and find it again.\n\nI managed to pull through and reignite my passion thanks to many awesome\npeople I work with and some highly influential\ndevelopers like [Iris Classon](http://irisclasson.com/) and [John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/).\nBy sharing my passion, I can see how it rubs off on others.\n\nNow, open your favorite editor or IDE and go write something that kicks ass.\nDon't forget to share your passion and what you learn with those around you!\n",

I once joined a team that had pressure from all angles.\nFixed deadlines, unexpected and sometimes last minute scope changes,\nresponsible for numerous front-end websites integrating into a highly sensitive\nservice that we had to maintain and was audited regularly.\nMistakes in the entire flow could cost production companies millions and\npeople their jobs.\n\nThe biggest problem with this team was the high staff turnover. Within a few\nmonths of joining, developers started leaving; one month after the other. When new\npeople joined the team, they were completely new to the company which made\nramp up time a nightmare.\n\nIt wasn't just the developers who left. People from all roles either left or\nwere rotated to other teams. Everyone was looking to me for answers to\nquestions I couldn't give. I struggled to keep up with all the changes as well\nas ramping up.\n\nThis was hell for me. I thought I caused people to leave. It turned out that\nthe team always had a bad reputation for change but knowing that didn't help.\nI needed a survival guide.\n\n## Social change is inevitable\n\nPeople come and go. Opportunities present themselves and people want to grow.\nThis could be to upskill in a different team or company.\n\nUnfortunately many developers migrate within the first two years\nat a company to explore different types of domains.\n\nLearn what you can through team members and wish them the best when they\nmove along. Don't create the perception that you are the problem.\n\n## You're not responsible for everything\n\nDon't take on the responsibility of everyone who leaves. You will only stress\nyourself out and end up with insomnia.\n\nYou could share the responsibility with the team for a short time while\nsomeone is ramping up. Know that you should push back more. Get business and\nline managers to figure things out together.\n\n## Expectations need to be managed\n\nAs people leave the team you need to start\n[managing expectations](/blog/manage-expectations) with your line manager and the\nProduct Owner. Offer trade-offs or alternatives. Explain in non-technical\nterms why you can't achieve this now.\n\n## Relationships are essential\n\nIf you are consuming data or features from other teams, or dependent on their\nrendered services then it is essential to find out who they are and what they\ndo. Start talking to them. Building strong relationships with people help you\nsolve problems quicker and exposes your to different parts of the business.\n\n## Ask when you need help\n\nIf you don't know what is cooking, put up your hand and say \"Yo! I am clueless\nhere. Who can we talk to?\". (_Maybe drop the \"Yo!\" if you want to be more\nprofessional._) Get the right people together and talk. Figure out problems\ntogether.\n\nYou might not always get the right people together but it gets better the\nmore you familiarize yourself with the people, products and business. This also\nmakes life easier when you rotate to a different team as those relationships are\nalready built.\n\n## Communicate suggestions\n\nIf you find flaws or processes that hinder productivity in your team,\nand you have suitable suggestions to improve, communicate it to the appropriate\nchannels - your team, line-manager, HR or head of division. This could be as\nsimple as how people are ramped up.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nChange in a team will happen. Hopefully never as drastic as what I experienced.\nIt's sad when people leave because bonds are formed but we can't stay in the\nsame environment and position forever. We want new challenges and\nnew experiences.\n\nDealing with too much change at any given time is exhausting. Productivity will\nbe affected. Push back and manage expectations. Remember to breathe\nand don't be afraid to ask for help.\n\n### Side-note\n\nThat team has now been split into two. One for the front-ends and one for the\nservice. They have a separation of concerns and have split the workload and\nlevel of responsibility. Both teams are more stable than before.\n",

It's guaranteed and there's no way to control it.\nThat's what makes [epic fail videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=epic+failes)\nso popular.\n\nWhile we aren't failing on such epic proportions in our professional capacity,\nwe are still surrounded by a lot of stupid things that collectively make up our\ndays. Like it or not, everyone contributes.\n\nI keep saying that we are all human, we all make mistakes and we all have\nsubjective perspectives. I know this. But it doesn't mean that it doesn't\nget frustrating.\n\nYet I constantly find myself doing stupid things even if I don't know it at the\ntime.\n\n## Lower expectations\n\nUnfortunately I have exceptionally high expectations; a disadvantage of being a\n[millennial or Generation Y](http://www.consultancy.uk/news/2061/generation-y-less-satisfied-than-other-generations).\nIt makes it hard for me to deal with what I perceive to be\ninconsiderate behavior and bad work etiquette.\n\nIt gets exhausting to try be patient and stay understanding. I need to lower\nmy expectations. Bring it closer to reality without negatively\nimpacting me. I don't know how to do this entirely but I know that I need to\nstop chasing [unicorns](/blog/the-perfect-illusion/).\n\n> Check out this cool [infographic](/infographics/data-behind-why-generation-y-is-unhappy/) showing the data\n> behind why Generation Y yuppies are unhappy.\n\n## Accept the reality\n\nI kept trying to find ways to completely eliminate pain in our team. Then\nsomeone told me that although pain can be minimized it can never be eliminated.\n\nThis shift in mindset took boulders off my shoulders. My goal would never\nbe reached so I need to aim lower.\n\nThe reality of our existence is that there will always be stupid shit happening\naround us. We are married to it until death do us part. We need to accept it\nand find better ways to deal with it.\n\n### Highlight frustrations\n\nI let frustrations build up. This in itself is stupid. All it takes is a\nconversation with the person in question. Often uncomfortable but\nsuch to be had. If conversation doesn't work, escalate.\n\nThis is simple right? Not for me. I didn't even think about it until it was\nbrought to my attention.\n\n### Get the right people talking\n\nI was getting worked up because people weren't talking to each other. Maybe they\nwere but they weren't all on the same page. Then someone told me if everyone\ntalks to each other all the time, no one would be able to do any work. We need\nthe right people to talk to the right people.\n\nHmmm. I accept that, especially in large organizations. So who are the right\npeople?\n\nI don't know but we can start where we have control and try branch out to find\nthe right people to give us the answers we need.\n\n-   What information does the team need in order to maintain their product and\n    create new features?\n-   What information does the team need to make sure all aspects of their product\n    is working (monitoring and health checks)?\n-   What would a new person need to get started in the team?\n-   What keeps impeding work from getting done?\n\n### Highlight team dysfunction\n\nAnother stupid thing I find myself doing is fulfilling roles when there\nis a gap. I'm naturally cross-functional and can slot in anywhere:\nProcess → UX → Design → Frontend → Backend →\nDevOps → Technical Support.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with being able to do this but a big red flag needs\nto be raised when it causes extra overhead which impedes my duties and\ncauses unnecessary stress. The business needs to be aware of the underlying\nproblems.\n\n-   Do we have a shortage of professionals in the team?\n-   Do we have professionals with the right skills in the team?\n-   Are the professionals in the team actually doing their work?\n-   Are the professionals in the team being asked to do work elsewhere?\n-   Are the professionals a cultural fit for the team?\n-   Is there an underlying problem causing a spike in staff turnover?\n\n> Notice how I did not once use the term resource. Spread the word.\n\n### Find a mentor\n\nBeing a human being is complicated. We are tangled with all sorts of\npsychological behaviors making us all different. It's interesting to see how\nwe are shaped by our experiences as we age. But we don't have to figure\nout this life-business on our own.\n\nFind people who can offer you food-for-thought. This is usually someone that\ndoesn't agree with your current mindset. Use these opportunities to\nextract valuable insights from conversations to help you cope better with\nfrustrations.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nLiz Ryan\n[wrote](http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2015/05/15/ten-stupid-things-i-have-fired-people-for-doing/#69f74563cfed)\nthat \"sometimes we do things that seem really stupid at the time but that turn\nout to be smart moves in the long run.\" So maybe something appears stupid now\nbut actually has great benefits later. Who knows?!\n\nAs we are all part of the problem I guess we just need to find better ways of\ndealing with it. It's also a good idea to use it to our advantage so that we\ncan continuously improve. Be the change we want to see even if we make a\nblunder of it. Hopefully it's not as costly as what happened to these companies:\n\n<iframe class=\"youtube\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w8qBzMl7_Q0\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n\n> If you don’t fail it’s because you did not risk enough, and if you didn’t\n> risk enough it’s because you didn’t put your whole self out there.\n> ~ Carlos Barrabes\n\n* * *\n\nA big thanks to [Thane Thomson](https://thanethomson.com/) for sharing his\ninsights with me to help me cope better with my frustrations and bring me closer\nto reality.\n",

I've let so many opportunities pass me by because I was scared.\n\nAt the end of April, I got a tweet asking if I'd be interested in giving an\n[Ignite talk](http://www.ignitetalks.io/)\nat [Jozi-JUG](http://www.meetup.com/Jozi-JUG/)—a local Java User Group.\n\nMy initial response was \"hell no\" but I responded by saying I'll check it out\nand decided to submit a talk titled\n\"[Branding Your Identity](/blog/branding-your-identity).\"\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riggaroo\">@riggaroo</a>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cbillowes\">@cbillowes</a>\n    interested in giving a 20 slide 5 minute talk?\n    <a href=\"https://t.co/TIyjkXOHH8\">https://t.co/TIyjkXOHH8</a>\n  </p>\n  &mdash; Dean Gerber (@dean_gerber)\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dean_gerber/status/726039414351253504\">\n    April 29, 2016\n  </a>\n</blockquote>\n\nGiving a 5 minute talk can't be that bad, can it? \\*facepalm\\*\n\nI struggled to prepare because of the fear that had built up within me not to\nmention my debilitating [inner perfectionist](/blog/the-perfect-illusion/) that\nimpeded me from progressing.\n\n## Don't be afraid to ask for help\n\nCloser to the deadline, I started freaking out. This is when I decided to\nreach out to the community (at work and on Twitter)—which I\nshould've done earlier.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    What do you do to calm your nerves before you give a talk/presentation?\n  </p>\n  &mdash; Clarice Bouwer (@cbillowes)\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cbillowes/status/737637601667059712\">May 31, 2016</a>\n</blockquote>\n\nThanks to so many amazing people I have been given pearls of wisdom to help me\ndeal with my fears which I'd like to share with you.\n\n### Take tips from the Pros\n\nLifeHack shared some great\n[content](http://www.lifehack.org/400146/7-public-speaking-tips-from-world-class-ted-presenters)\nabout public speaking tips from world-class TED presenters.\n\n-   Show up to give, not take\n-   Focus on your breath to stay focused\n-   Leave the slides for the boardroom\n-   Use plain English\n-   Leverage the power of the pause\n-   Embrace the art of the unexpected\n-   Get the audience involved\n\n<small>\n  Thanks to Justin Reddy for sharing.\n</small>\n\n* * *\n\n[Robin Sharma](http://www.robinsharma.com/), a self-help writer and\nleadership speaker, shares some ideas in 9 minutes to help you overcome your\nfears.\n\n<iframe\n  class=\"youtube\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vae0sHrNfFc\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n\n<small>\n  Thanks to [Indran Naidoo](https://twitter.com/indrannaidoo) for sharing.\n</small>\n\n* * *\n\n[Ben Orenstein](https://twitter.com/r00k) presented a great 48 minute talk with\nstraightforward techniques for giving excellent presentations.

Because one tends to reject or remain ignorant of\nthe least desirable aspects of one's personality, the shadow is largely\nnegative, or (2) the entirety of the unconscious, i.e., everything of which\na person is not fully conscious.\"_\n\nI don't know where my phobia stems from but my shadow self is filled with public\nspeaking grief. It has so much power over me.\n\nIt was suggested that instead of hiding from this grief and trying to be someone\nI am not, I should face it. Try to fully understand it from the perspective of\nanother human being.\n\nThis concept is new to me and I may not have given it justice here,\nbut it has helped me by thinking \"I'm not scared, you are [shadow self],\nso let's do this together.\"\n\n<small>\n  Thanks to [Thane Thomson](https://twitter.com/thanethomson) for introducing\n  me to this concept.\n</small>\n\n### Stand on a chair\n\nStanding on a chair while practicing your speech feels awkward. This can help\nequip you for the awkwardness you will feel on the day of the delivery.\n\nUnfortunately I don't own chairs that I can stand on but I did take\naway the gist of \"embracing the awkwardness\". So I decided to leverage this.\n\nI went into a few of our delivery teams and asked if they had five minutes to\nlisten to my talk that I will be presenting. When I got the go-ahead I didn't\ngive my racing heart time to catch up as I dove straight into my speech.\n\nYes, this is awkward. Asking people to listen to me just out of the blue is\nweird. But it's useful, builds confidence and prepares you for talking in front\nof some people.\n\n<small>\n  Thanks to [Jimi Lutz](https://twitter.com/jimilutz) for this awesome\n  suggestion.\n</small>\n\n### Record yourself\n\nI recorded videos of myself while I practiced my speech at home. I was able to\nnotice how my delivery changed the moment I knew I was being recorded. I'd\nstumble and make so many mistakes.\n\nThis also tied in nicely with embracing the awkwardness.\n\n<small>\n  Thanks to [Malay Pandey](https://twitter.com/malaykp) for this great\n  suggestion.\n</small>\n\n### The audience isn't your enemy\n\nIt is important to remember that the audience is not your enemy, in fact they\nare rooting for you. They know it is scary being up there and they are most\nlikely going to be forgiving when you make mistakes. They don't want to see you\nfail.\n\n<small>\n  Thanks to [Seef Oosthuizen](https://twitter.com/S33F) sharing this insight.\n</small>\n\n### Practice\n\nBeing prepared is important and thanks to my husband and many people I work\nwith at [DStv Digital Media](http://dstvdm.dstv.com/), I have been given the\nopportunity to practice my speech and get constructive criticism to help me\nimprove.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nFears can be paralyzing. I decided to reach out to the community for guidance.\nThis gave me courage and strength to confront my fears without backing out.\n\nI want to a live a life where I grab opportunities that build me. I want to\nsucceed. Tackling this fear is a big win for me, regardless of the outcome it\nhas on Saturday.\n\n* * *\n\nThanks to [Olga](https://twitter.com/chaos_olga) for coaching me and to\neveryone at\n[DStv Digital Media](http://dstvdm.dstv.com/),\n[Britehouse](http://www.britehouse.co.za/Pages/default.aspx) and\n[DVT](http://www.dvt.co.za/) who listened to my\ndry runs and offered me so much support, constructive criticism and motivation.\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n",

There are so many technologies that it is\nimpossible to know everything.\n\nYet recruiting is largely based on experience, instead of the ability to learn\nsomething new quickly. _Although the former is important, the latter should be\ntaken into account especially if you consider how technologies keep changing\nat such a rapid rate._\n\nThere's no shortage of software developers. In 2013,\n[TechRepublic](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/european-technology/there-are-185-million-software-developers-in-the-world-but-which-country-has-the-most/)\nestimated there to 18.5 million software developers in the world.\n\nSo if you want to stand out in this competing market, without having to know\neverything, then you can turn to marketing.\n\n## My failure\n\nBut let's face it. It's something most developers are bad at, and I know. I have\ntried and failed time and time again.\n\nMy attempts at blogging were so bad that in 10 years I had 4 blogs—that\nfailed. In total I had about 20 posts.\n\n-   I didn't stick to a schedule\n-   Others were already writing about what I wanted to write about\n-   Each post took long to write\n-   My topics weren't focused so my posts were sort of random\n-   I doubted myself too much\n\nI declined opportunities to speak at events and conferences because:\n\n-   I didn't feel qualified enough\n-   I didn't know what to present or talk about\n-   I didn't believe in myself\n-   I have a phobia for public speaking\n\nAs I doubted myself so much, I'd panic during interviews and tests, and If I got\nthe job, I'd have to build my reputation from the ground up as people didn't\nknow who I was and what I was technically capable of.\n\n## My realization\n\nWith time I came to realize that having an **engaging community presence\nis far more beneficial than experience alone**. The more value you add to the\ncommunity, the more exposure you get. This attracts opportunities.\n\nBut I was held back by fear which stemmed mainly from self doubt.\n**This had to stop**. If I wanted to make a name for myself in the community,\nI'd have to push past those fears.\n\n## My journey\n\nSo I adjusted my mindset. I started looking at marketing myself as more of a\njourney with small steps I could take to gradually build my reputation.\n\nI officially started my journey in 2014 by attending meetups and engaging\nmore with the community.\n\n-   I'm now more active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cbillowes)\n-   I'm writing an article for [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com)\n-   I'm consistent on my blog\n-   And I presented my first talk at\n    [Jozi-JUG](http://meetup.com/Jozi-JUG/events/229688441/) on 4 June 2016\n\nAdmittedly it's easier to get started if you have help. I started my blog by\ntaking a [course](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/) from\n[John Sonmez](https://twitter.com/jsonmez) and he personally guided and\nmotivated me through this step. _It's a free three week email course\nthat I would encourage any software developer to take._\n\nI contributed **18 posts** to my blog in the first month. That's 2 posts shy\nfrom my decade of attempts.\n\n## The benefits\n\nBut there is more to marketing yourself than just your reputation. This is the\ncrux of the reasoning behind why I started doing this.\n\n### You get exposure\n\nYou get exposed to other developers which gives you the opportunity to learn\nand grow from the greatest minds all over the world.\n\nBy being engaged with your local software community, people start acknowledging\nyour skills. Eventually, you won't be starting at a company or team in your\norganization without a reputation.\n\n### You are challenged\n\nBy sharing what you learn, people offer you feedback. This keeps you challenged.\n\nEmbrace the positive feedback you get and look at the negative feedback\nobjectively. You can extract learning points from both to improve.\n\nIf people offer you constructive criticism, they offer you the opportunity to\nimprove.\n\nWhen you put an idea out there, your idea could be countered with a different\nperspective. This opens new avenues of thinking.\n\n### You create living documentation\n\nBy being consistent, you create living documentation. This is more powerful\nand engaging than a CV.\n\nIt's also a great reference for later in life to see how you've grown;\nsomething I wish I had now. It's also a great personal reference for things\nyou may have encountered in the past that you may now have forgotten.\n\n### Your confidence grows\n\nLearning from the community is much faster than learning everything on your\nown.\n\nBy continuously interacting and engaging with the community, you are bound to\nsee your confidence levels grow.\n\n## Anyone can start\n\nRemember that technologies keep changing so you don't have to be an expert to\nstart sharing what you learn.\n\nStart writing about what you learn while you are learning it and share it with\nthe community.\n\n_If you want to see a great example on how someone started without being an\nexpert and how living documentation was created then check out\n[Iris Classon's](http://irisclasson.com) blog._\n\n## Platforms\n\nWhen you are comfortable with your chosen platform and you are ready to branch\nout, then try other platforms:\n\n-   Create a blog\n-   Appear on a podcast / video interview\n-   Create your own videos or podcasts\n-   Write an article for your favorite website\n-   Create a tutorial\n-   Speak at an event/meetup\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nI'm not saying this is going to be easy, in fact it's a lot of hard work with\nmany ups and downs and it can be absolutely terrifying putting yourself out\nthere.\n\nBut software development isn't just about your technical skills, so take it\none step at a time.\n\n* * *\n\nMost of the content here formed part of my Ignite talk that I presented a\nJozi-JUG on 4 June 2016. Although the slides are mainly images, you can still\naccess them [here](/slides/branding-your-identity/){:target=\"\\_blank\"}. _I've\ncompressed the images quite a bit so quality is lacking._\n\nAs I have such a phobia, I reached out to the community to figure out how\nI could\n[cope with my fears of public speaking](/blog/coping-with-fears-of-public-speaking/).\nThis helped me prepare for the day of my delivery which went quite well.\n",

Possible use cases include:\n\n-   Visual aid for designing a mobile-first and / or responsive web site\n-   Verify your implementation after you have implemented a design given to\n    you by a front-end developer or agency\n-   Verify device, browser or OS specific features implemented on a web page\n-   Mimic browsing from a specific location\n-   Mimic different network conditions\n\n**Disclaimer:** This tool will only simulate the display of a web page\nrendered by your version of the Chrome browser, so don't assume it works as expected\nacross all devices and browsers. It can't emulate the performance\ncharacteristics of a real device. There are tools and services that can be\nused to achieve this but is beyond the scope of this topic.\n\n## Getting started\n\n1.  Open the **Developer Tools** window.\n\n    Open the **Chrome menu**\n    ![Chrome menu icon](/img/posts/chrome/icon-chrome-menu.png \"Chrome menu icon\")\n    at the top-right of your browser window, then select\n    **More tools > Developer tools**.\n\n    Use a shortcut:\n\n    -   Windows: `F12` or `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I`\n    -   Mac: `Cmd` + `Opt` + `I`\n\n2.  Enable the **Device Mode** feature.\n\n    Click on the **Device Mode**\n    ![Device Mode icon](/img/posts/chrome/icon-device-mode.png \"Device Mode icon\")\n    icon at the top-left of the **Developer Tools** window.\n\n    You could use shortcuts, but make sure the focus is on the Developer Tools\n    window and not the browser window for it to work.\n\n    -   Windows: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `M`\n    -   Mac: `Cmd` + `Shift` + `M`\n\nYou can disable Device Mode by clicking on the icon or using the same\nshortcuts as above.\n\n## Viewport controls\n\nThese controls give you the ability to test your web page across a variety of\ndevices or directly interact with the responsive nature of it. You can change\nthe device, width, height, zoom and orientation _(if height is present)_.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/chrome-device-mode/viewport-controls.jpg\"\n     description=\"iPad device selected through the Viewport controls\"\n%}\n\n### Pre-configured devices\n\nYou can add pre-configured devices to the list by clicking on\n**Device dropdown > Edit...**. Check the boxes of the devices you want to add\nto the list. Click on the device dropdown in the viewport controls to see your\nupdated list.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/chrome-device-mode/emulated-devices.jpg\"\n     description=\"Selected Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy Note II in emulated devices<br/>\n       to add them to the list of devices\"\n%}\n\n### Custom devices\n\nYou can add your own devices by following the same steps as above but instead of\nchecking boxes you can click on the **Add custom device...** button.\n\n**Note:** The simulator makes use of User Agent strings. These are used by\nweb browsers and applications to identify themselves by web servers.\n\nYou can get a comprehensive list from\n[User Agent String.com](http://www.useragentstring.com/).\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/chrome-device-mode/add-custom-device.jpg\"\n     description=\"Add custom device using User Agent String for SeaMonkey on Linux<br/>\n       <code>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20120501 Firefox/12.0 SeaMonkey/2.9.1 Lightning/1.4</code>\"\n%}\n\n**Tip:** Increase the height of the Developer Tools window before adding the new device.\nThe Settings modal overlays the Developer Tools window. If you increase\nthe height of the window, the overlay will fill it. Unfortunately once the\nmodal is open, the window height cannot be adjusted _(at least not on Windows)_.\n\n## Media queries\n\nYou can use the media query inspector by clicking on **Show media queries** in\nthe vertical three dot menu at the top-right corner of the Viewport controls.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/chrome-device-mode/show-media-queries.jpg\"\n     description=\"Media queries inspector on iPad display\"\n%}\n\nThe media queries for the web page are detected and displayed as colored bars.\nWhen you **right-click** on a color, you can reveal the CSS in the source code.\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n  <span style=\"width: 1em; height: 1em; background-color: #327ff2; display: inline-block; margin-right: 0.5em;\"></span>\n  Queries targeting a maximum width<br/>\n  Example: <code>@media only screen and (max-width: 960px)</code>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n  <span style=\"width: 1em; height: 1em; background-color: #3b9903; display: inline-block; margin-right: 0.5em;\"></span>\n  Queries targeting widths within a range<br/>\n  Example: <code>@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width:960px)</code>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n  <span style=\"width: 1em; height: 1em; background-color: #d4731f; display: inline-block; margin-right: 0.5em;\"></span>\n  Queries targeting a minimum width<br/>\n  Example: <code>@media (min-width: 768px)</code>\n</div>\n\n**Tip:** If you are inspecting minified CSS (or JavaScript), you will notice\na curly brace icon **{ }** at the bottom of the view pane next to the line number.\nClick on this to format the source code for easier reading.\n\n## Connection throttling\n\nYou can mimic different network related behaviors by throttling your connection\nspeed for the tab you are inspecting on.\n\nClick on **Show throttling** in the vertical three dot menu at the top-right\ncorner of the Device Mode window. Select a speed to test your page at. You\nwill need to refresh the page to see the result. You may also want to monitor\nyour network traffic and page load time using the **Network** tab in the\nDeveloper Tools window.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/chrome-device-mode/throttling.jpg\"\n     description=\"GPRS selected in throttling options\"\n%}\n\nFor out more about\n[optimizing performance under varying network conditions](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/profile/network-performance/network-conditions).\n\n## Emulate sensors\n\nWhen developing on a desktop you are at a disadvantage as there isn't native\nsupport hardware for GPS and accelerometers.\n\nChrome DevTools has a **Sensors Emulation** feature which allows you to\noverride geolocation coordinates and device orientation accelerometer data.\n\nClick on the vertical three dot menu at the top-right corner of the Developer Tools\nwindow > **More tools > Sensors**.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/chrome-device-mode/sensors.jpg\"\n     description=\"Enabled emulate geolocation coordinates and device orientation<br/>\n       selected in sensors tab with default data\"\n%}\n\nFind out more about [emulating sensors](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/device-mode/device-input-and-sensors).\n\n* * *\n\n## Resources\n\n-   [Chrome Keyboard and UI Shortcuts Reference](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/inspect-styles/shortcuts)\n-   [Simulate Mobile Devices with Device Mode](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/device-mode/)\n-   [Test Responsive and Device-specific Viewports](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/device-mode/emulate-mobile-viewports)\n",

Now, when I refer to designs in this case I mean anything from a house\nthat was built down to your toaster. How many shortcuts were taken to get\nthe job done?\n\n## Technical Debt\n\nIn software, we refer to the build up of bad shortcuts as \"technical debt\" -\nhacks or bad implementations that build over time that should be fixed in\nfuture iterations. In reality, how often do they get attended to?\n\nLooking at the software stack we can see how some decisions and changes that\nbuild over time can cause horrors behind the scenes, all the way from graphics to the\nentire system architecture:\n\n-   **Graphics**. Think Photoshop. How many revisions of that file exist? How many\n    layers are there? How many layers are actually named?\n\n-   **Websites**. Think about how many lines appear in each script or stylesheet?\n    How well formatted is the HTML? Are there tables defining the layout?\n    Let's not get started on the optimization of images.\n\n-   **Applications & Services**. Where is the business logic? What does the mapping\n    or Anti-Corruption Layer look like? What does the configuration file look\n    like? Where are the passwords stored? What does the documentation look like?\n\n-   **System architecture**. Do you know what servers and services are being used\n    and by whom? Are they routed correctly? Can you easily detect if there is a\n    problem with the load balancing? How do you know if one of the nodes are not\n    responding correctly? Perhaps draw a system diagram of an enterprise system\n    just to shock yourself.\n\n-   **Organization**. _(Heck, let's throw in the business too)_ What does the\n    company structure of an enterprise organization look like? Draw another\n    diagram just to confuse yourself. How often does it change?\n\nBehind anything that looks appealing is something dark and sinister looming and\nwaiting to jump out at you and scream \"BOO!\"\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n   url=\"/img/posts/the-horror-behind-design/technical-debt.jpg\"\n   description=\"There's a big difference between what the customer sees and what the developer sees.\"\n   image_source=\"Source of image unknown\"\n%}\n\nWe are in the real world where things change rapidly. Deadlines loom,\npeople change, teams change, strategies change, organizations\nand companies change. So, it seriously becomes tough to keep things looking\ngood under the hood of our applications.\n\nWorst of all, the code you wrote that looks great today will suck in the\nfuture and may possibly make someone want to pull their hair out. _This someone\ncould be future you._\n\nOn the bright side, at least you know you are learning and improving but\nunfortunately you are actively contributing to today's problems.\n\n## It's a harsh reality\n\nLet's pause. Breathe. Before you throw verbal rocks at me, or even worse, throw\nyour craft out the window, hear me out.\n\n1.  I apologize for painting this depressing picture. I didn't do it\n    to instill doom and gloom, I promise.\n\n2.  We can't use these issues as a scapegoat. Imagine the horrors we would face if\n    we didn't actually try our best.\n\n### Accept it\n\nI highlighted the reality because a while ago I was crippled by the concept of\nclean code. I became a digital neat freak and I was fighting a losing battle.\nI became so particular with practices, principles and the opinions of others\nthat I didn't want to write code anymore.\n\nNow that's a terrible place to be in. When you are cognizant of code smells,\nthen code smells stand out like `NullReferenceException`'s.\n\nAccept that code will never be perfect.\n\n### Free yourself\n\nI believe that great software developers know that their code is not great.\nThey know that they aren't digital gods amongst mere mortals. They are aware\nof trade-offs and the impact of their decisions. And one day they will look\nback on their code and think \"what the hell was I trying to do here?\"\nBut they try and they improve.\n\nKnowing this makes contributing to source code less daunting. Let this free\nyourself from any debilitating feelings you may have when it comes to writing\ncode.\n\n### Just try your best\n\nThe practices, principles and opinions others have are born from mistakes that\nwere made in the past. It's important to add this to your development toolbox\nand know what to use and when. Just try your best.\n\n### Be kind to others\n\nWhen you see someone is writing code (or has written code) that could cause a potential meltdown,\neither to you or to the production environment, kindly let the person know\nwhy the implementation is not a good idea.\n\nBeing harsh without practical validation only creates a negative environment\nwhere people choose not to collaborate.\n\nYou can't change the way people think but you can positively influence them.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nWe need to be less harsh on ourselves and on others. The best we can do is try\nto improve our craft, write the cleanest code we know how at that point in time,\nlearn from our mistakes (and that of others) and always aim to improve.\n\n### Summary\n\n-   Accept that code will never be perfect.\n-   Even the best software developers make mistakes.\n-   Just try your best.\n-   Learn from your mistakes and that of others.\n-   You can't change the way people think but you can positively influence them.\n\n### Learning materials\n\n-   [**Pluralsight**](https://www.pluralsight.com/)\n\n-   [**Code Complete**](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/):\n    A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition by\n    [Steve McConnell](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-McConnell/e/B000APETRK/)\n\n-   [**The Clean Coder**](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073/):\n    A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, First Edition by\n    [Robert C.

However, we no longer need to\nprovide the `http-equiv` and `content` attributes.\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-markup\">\n&lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n### Script references\n\nBrowsers by default assume scripts are written in JavaScript so the\n`type=\"text/javascript\"` attribute can now be dropped.\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-markup\">\n&lt;script src=\"script.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n### CSS references\n\nWe no longer need to specify `type=\"text/css\"` when referencing external\nstylesheets.\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-markup\">\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n### MathML & SVG\n\nThese elements can now be used within an HTML document without having to specify\ntheir XML namespaces.\n\n### Syntax\n\nXHTML 1.0 enforces HTML to follow the same syntax as XML: all tags in lowercase,\nattributes quoted, elements must be properly closed.\n\nHTML5 is case-insensitive and has no rules when it comes to the style of\nwriting markup.\n\n### Content model\n\nThis defines what child or descendant elements can be nested within an element.\nPreviously there were two major categories namely \"inline\" and \"block-level\"\nwhich had different rules based on the flavor (Strict, Traditional and Frameset)\nof HTML.\n\nThese terms also caused confusion with CSS so HTML5 no longer uses them.\nInstead it categorized content based on how they can be nested.\n\nNot all elements appear in these categories but those that do can overlap\nother categories.\n\n-   **Metadata** content e.g. `link` & `script`\n-   **Flow** content e.g. `span` & `div`\n-   **Sectioning** content e.g. `aside` & `section`\n-   **Heading** content e.g. `h1` - `h6`\n-   **Phrasing** content e.g. `span` & `img`\n-   **Embedded** content e.g. `img`, `iframe` & `svg`\n-   **Interactive** content e.g. `a`, `button` & `label`\n\n## Obsolete\n\nHTML5 no longer deprecates elements or attributes as it remains backwards\ncompatible instead they flag them as obsolete.\n\nThey shouldn't be used by web developers however user agents will still have\nto support them.\n\n-   Purely presentational\n\n    `basefont`, `big`, `center`, `font`, `strike`, `tt`\n\n-   Damages usability and accessibility\n\n    `frame`, `frameset`, `noframes`\n\n-   Not used often, caused confusion or its function is handled by another element\n\n    `acronym`, `applet`, `isindex`, `dir`\n\nA number of [attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/#obsolete-attributes)\nhave also been made obsolete.\n\n## Redefined\n\nSome elements have been semantically redefined.\n\n-   `a` element now has a transparent content model. This means you are legally\n    allowed to nest a `div` element if its parent allows flow content.\n\n-   `b` element makes text stylistically bold and **does not** indicate importance. To\n    indicate importance you should use `strong`.\n\n-   `i` element makes text stylistically italic and **does not** indicate emphasis. To\n    emphasize something you should use `em`.\n\n-   `cite` element represents the title of creative work like a movie, documentary or\n    book. The browser will render the citation in italics.\n\n-   `small` element is independent of its styled presentation and is now used for\n    side-comments and small print, including copyright and legal text.\n\n## New additions\n\nThese elements were introduced to enhance the structure of a document:\n\n`section`, `article`, `main`, `aside`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `figure`,\n`figcaption`, `template`\n\nOther new elements include:\n\n`video`, `audio`, `track`, `embed`, `mark`, `progress`, `meter`, `time`, `ruby`,\n`rt`, `rp`, `bdi`, `wbr`, `canvas`, `datalist`, `keygen`, `output`\n\nThe `input` element has new values for the `type` attribute:\n\n`tel`, `search`, `url`, `email`, `date`, `time`, `number`, `range`, `color`\n\n## JavaScript APIs\n\nFor a long time browser implementers were making up JavaScript APIs for\nbrowsers. Now the HTML 5 specification has sections dedicated to web application\nAPIs. Some include:\n\n-   Drag and drop\n-   Fullscreen\n-   History\n-   IndexDB\n-   Online and Offline events\n-   Pointer Lock\n-   Web storage\n-   Web workers\n\n* * *\n\n## References\n\n-   A Book Apart: [HTML5 for web designers](https://abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers)\n    by Jeremy Keith\n-   [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/index.html) by\n    the WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group)\n-   [HTML5 Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)\n    from Mozilla Developer Network\n-   [Differences from HTML4](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/)\n-   [10 HTML APIs worth looking into](https://www.sitepoint.com/10-html5-apis-worth-looking/)\n",

[Fiddles.io](https://fiddles.io/) has a great catalog to help\nyou discover them.\n\n<b>Side note</b>: Funny enough, there is also a fiddle for an esoteric programming language called\n[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) - _the name really says\nit all about this language_.\n\nIn this post I'll be sharing some use cases with you as well as some of my\ncurrently favorite fiddle editors.\n\n## Usages\n\nYou can use fiddles for just about anything. Some examples include:\n\n-   Provide a visual & interactive answer to a question\n-   Embed a code sample that can be executed on your blog\n-   Familiarize yourself with or learn a language before you adopt it\n-   Quickly test behavior and quirks of a language\n-   Build a test case for a bug\n-   Showcase your skills\n-   Get inspiration and design patterns for your projects from other fiddles\n\n## CodePen\n\n[CodePen](http://codepen.io/) refers to their fiddles as \"Pens\". Pens can\nbe created for any front end web experiment you wish you create.\n\nTo find out more, you can [read about](https://codepen.io/hello/) CodePen and\nits super cool editor.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/discovering-fiddles/codepen.jpg\"\n     link=\"<http://codepen.io/>\"\n     description=\"A screenshot of the CodePen layout\"\n%}\n\n### Layout\n\nThere are three input panels allowing you to enter markup, styles and\nscripts complimented by a result panel.\n\nTo avoid context-switching and for\n[other reasons](https://blog.codepen.io/2016/01/27/new-feature-javascript-console/)\nthere is a development console available.\n\nThey have also catered for the keyboard-focused developer by adding some rad\nshortcuts.\n\n### Preprocessors\n\nThere is support for many popular preprocessors for HTML, CSS and JavaScript\nand it even lets you view the compiled source.\n\n### Styling and scripting features\n\nYou can normalize your base styles and automatically add vendor prefixing so that you\ndon't have to prefix everything yourself.\n\nYou can reference external libraries and stylesheets or quickly select\nsome of the popular ones used.\n\n### Code formatting\n\nYour code can get messy, especially if you are writing it quickly. Sometimes you\nalso end up pasting code that isn't formatted correctly or doesn't follow your\nformatting. You can tidy up your code by using the tidy feature.\nYou can also validate your stylesheets and scripts by linting them.\n\n### Sharing\n\nOnce you have a pen rockin' and rollin' you can export it as a `.zip` file,\nsave it as a gist, share it on social media or embed it on your blog like this\none:\n\n<figure>\n  <p data-height=\"350\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"mJBYqy\" data-default-tab=\"css,result\" data-user=\"maneeshc\" data-embed-version=\"2\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/maneeshc/pen/mJBYqy/\">Digital Clock</a> by Maneesh (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/maneeshc\">@maneeshc</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n  <script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n  <figcaption>Old school digital clock pen by <a href=\"http://codepen.io/maneeshc\">Maneesh Chiba</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## JSFiddle\n\n[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) let's you test your front end web code\nwith their online code editor. You can follow this\n[tutorial](http://doc.jsfiddle.net/tutorial.html)\nto learn how to get started with it.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/discovering-fiddles/jsfiddle.jpg\"\n     link=\"<https://jsfiddle.net/>\"\n     description=\"A screenshot of the JSFiddle layout\"\n%}\n\n### Layout\n\nThere are three input panels allowing you to enter HTML, styling and\nscripting complimented by a result panel.\n\nThere is a sidebar that let's you create a title and description for your\nfiddle, reference external resources, gives you more information about\nAJAX requests and a link to their roadmap.\n\n### Preprocessors\n\nPreprocessors are not well supported at the moment. None for markup,\n`SCSS` for styling and `TypeScript`, `CoffeeScript` and `Babel` for scripting.\nTheir [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/LakLkQBW/jsfiddle-roadmap) indicates\nthey may possibly support these in the future.\n\n### Markup, styling & scripting features\n\nYou can select the flavor of HTML you wish to use in the `doctype` and\nnormalize your base styles.\n\nThey offer a wide range of libraries and versions that you can reference from\nwithin the JavaScript settings. Some include `mootools`, `jQuery` and `prototype`.\nYou can even specify how your JavaScript should be loaded: `onLoad`,\n`onDomready` `head` or `body`.\n\n### Code formatting\n\nYou can tidy your code when it gets messy and unreadable.\n\n### Sharing\n\nYour fiddle can be saved, embedded and collaborated on in real time. If you\nsee a fiddle you like, you can fork it and play around with it without affecting\nthe original one.\n\n## StackOverflow\n\n[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) has added their own code snippet\nflavor to their answering platform for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/discovering-fiddles/stackoverflow.jpg\"\n     link=\"<http://stackoverflow.com/>\"\n     description=\"A screenshot of the StackOverflow code snippet functionality\"\n%}\n\nYou can quickly write front end code from within the StackOverflow platform.\n\nIt allows you to reference a version of `jQuery`, `AngularJS`, `d3`, `Knockout`\nor reference an external library.\n\nYou can also tidy your code when it gets messy so that your questions and\nanswers are easier to follow.\n\nOnce you are done, you can insert the code as an interactive widget\ndirectly into your question or answer. How cool is that?\n\n## SQLFiddle\n\n[SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/) let's you create, build and populate tables\nwith T-SQL scripts on a variety of relational databases including MySql,\nOracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite and MS SQL Server.\n\nCheck [this](http://sqlfiddle.com/about.html) out if you want to learn more\nabout it.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/discovering-fiddles/sqlfiddle.jpg\"\n     link=\"<http://sqlfiddle.com/>\"\n     description=\"A screenshot of part of the SQLFiddle layout\"\n%}\n\n### Schema creation\n\nYou can create a schema by either entering `T-SQL` or by using their Text\nto DDL feature where you can paste or type out CSV, space separated or\npipe-delimited sample data.\n\n### Schema browser\n\nThere is a schema browser so that you can quickly see your tables and columns\nin an interactive tree view.\n\n### Code formatting\n\nYou can format your code when it gets messy and enter full screen mode when\nyou need more real estate to play with.\n\n### Sharing\n\nYour fiddles are saved but you will have to copy the URL in order to share it.\n\n* * *\n\n## References\n\n-   [Fiddles.io](https://fiddles.io/)\n-   [CodePen](http://codepen.io/)\n-   [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)\n-   [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/)\n-   [7 of the Best Code Playgrounds](https://www.sitepoint.com/7-code-playgrounds/)\n    by Craig Buckler at Sitepoint.\n",

It can be\ndetrimental to a person and those around them if received negatively.\n\nI'm sure you've experienced the ego and superiority complex within the\nsoftware development community.\n\nIt becomes a\n[liability](https://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/tech/post/on-ego-and-software-development/)\nas it can restrict people from improving. They become blind to learning better\nhabits, concepts, practices, and technologies through others.\n\nFor years there have been [constant arguments](https://dzone.com/articles/developer-ego)\nwithin the community regarding which languages, frameworks, tools, and\noperating systems are the best to use.\n\nAsking for help ends up in arguments with possible verbal abuse and belittling\nof skills and experience. StackOverflow is unfortunately an example of this.\nIt's notorious for\n[abusive commentary](https://sammaye.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/why-i-am-a-little-annoyed-with-stackoverflow-currently/).\n\nIt discourages people from collaborating. Proposed solutions are shot down\nwithout constructive reasoning. Often the responses are \"that's not how we've\ndone things before\" or \"that's not what I prefer to do.\" These behaviors often\nnullifies the advantages of code reviews and pair/mob programming.\n\nThese examples highlight some barriers that are created for communication,\ncollaboration and improvement. As software developers we are supposed to be\nrational thinkers but as human beings we are often driven by emotion.\n\nOn the other hand, without some sense of self-esteem or self-importance,\nhow can we trust our own judgements and decisions?\n\n> The issue is not to break free of the ego, escaping it or transcending it.\n> Rather it is to learn how to harness the ego and transform it to use it in a\n> way that serves us and helps us to create a life worth living.\n> ~ K. Ferlic in [Shifting Consciousness](http://ryuc.info/creativespirituality/shifting_consciousness.htm)\n\nWe can do this by finding ways to reduce the influence our ego has on us.\n\n> When the ego becomes imbalanced, all its hideous, negative aspects can act out.\n> Therefore it is my intention to balance the ego, not to destroy it.\n> ~ [Steve Mueller](http://sumo.ly/bMCD)\n\n## Don't sweat the small stuff\n\nIf your day is filled with accumulated frustrations just keep in mind that you\nhave the power to choose what frustrates you and what doesn't. You have\ncomplete control of your mind and body.\n\nThere is no such thing as a perfect codebase or platform.\nEverything has issues on some level. And what difference does it make when\nsomeone interrupts you or doesn't listen to you?\n\nAccept that nothing is perfect and make improvements where you can without being\nblinded by your frustrations.\n\nNote that I am not advocating bad code or behavior. I'm simply implying that you\ndon't need to build up frustrations that will one day erupt like a volcano.\nChoose what is important to you, action it or find an alternative.\n\n## Become self aware\n\nStart observing yourself. At the end of your day, reflect on your behavior and\nreactions to certain situations. The better you get at this, the more you\nnaturally start observing yourself in the moment.\n\nYou can also learn a lot through observing the positive and negative behavior\nand reactions of others.\n\nIf you feel the need to rant about something, ask yourself why you are so angry.\nIs there something you could have done to avoid the frustration or\nnegative feeling you have? Is it actually worth being frustrated about?\n\n## Have empathy\n\nPeople come from different walks of life with different personalities,\nbackgrounds, and experiences. We are all on different parts of our journey\nand have our own subjective perspectives.\n\nWe aren't all expressive when it comes to communicating our ideas and intentions\nso well that everyone understands them. Sometimes the wrong words are used to\nconvey a message. Sometimes there are language barriers and the person may be\nspeaking to you in a second language.\n\nRemember that nobody in your organization is stupid but mistakes will be made.\nSome people may feel over encumbered and are multitasking. Others may be\ncompletely disengaged due to certain circumstances that you may not be aware\nof.\n\nThere is a reason for poorly written code whether it be tight deadlines,\ninexperience, bad design, misunderstood requirements or software design,\nbad communication and collaboration or absolute defeat.\n\nHave empathy when working with others and on codebases.\n\n## Be humble\n\nTry to tame your superiority complex. If you believe that you are the best\ndeveloper in the world, you are most likely mistaken. You are bound to\nwrite shitty code that is going to make someone swear at you in the future.\n\nYou don't have to cling to your code. If someone suggests a useful improvement,\nthen why not implement it? You need to come to terms with the bigger picture.\n\nAccept criticism. Ask for it to be constructive if it isn't helpful to you.\nIf there is a reason why you don't agree with the criticism you receive, try\nto convey the right message across to gather more information or start a healthy\nconversation.\n\nActually listen to what people have to say and value their opinions even if\nyou don't necessarily agree.\n\n## Unite teams\n\nDon't work in a silo. Share your knowledge, ideas and opinions but do it in a\nway that is kind and gentle. Abrasive behavior results in negativity and fear.\n\nDon't be a [bad apple](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-bad-apple-group-poison/)\nin your team. Negativity radiates through a team and can cause its demise.\n\n## Be a leader\n\nI don't mean manage your team or those around you. I simply mean, lead by\nexample. Share your passion and knowledge that you have with others.\n\nCoach and guide people in your team on the right path and explain why you\nbelieve it is the right path.\n\nEncourage others to share their opinions, insights and to voice their concerns.\n\nPositive behavior is an uplifting and [powerful](/blog/reignite-the-passion/)\ntool within a team.\n\n## Persevere\n\nIt's not easy. You will make mistakes. Others will make mistakes. You will get\nfrustrated. Others will get frustrated. It's a natural order of chaos.\n\nDon't be defeated. Just keep trying and don't be too hard on yourself or those\naround you.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nThe bottom line is: **don't be a jerk**. Be the change you want to see\neven if it doesn't change anything right away.\n",

When they are prevalent, your team needs to find ways to\nstreamline the communication coming into the team so that you can support the\nproduct sustainably.\n\n## Support role\n\nYour team could introduce a rotating support role where one technical person\nhandles all incoming requests for that sprint and filters it into the team\nif necessary.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/streamline-communication/support-person.jpg\"\n     description=\"Communication from the product department, technology department, executives & stakeholders and users directly to the support person in a team.\"\n%}\n\nBased on the nature of the queries entering the team, an escalation process\ncan be created and shared with the organization in order to lessen the burden\non the person who is on support.\n\nSometimes you may end up in a situation where there are only one or two\ntechnically strong people in a team which makes a support role quite stressful.\n\nOpen communication channels between the product and technology team to highlight\nthe issues you are facing as a team so that they can find ways to mitigate\nthe unsustainable operational tasks you constantly need to tackle.\n\n**Tip**: If your team has a mailing list, ensure all communication is sent to\nthe team mailing list instead of directly to one person. The people within the\nteam can setup email rules to move all emails sent directly to the team so that\nit does not clutter their inbox. If anyone picks up an issue, they can resolve\nit if they have the capacity to do so as long as they communicate it with the\nrest of the team.\n\n## Operations team\n\nYou may be fortunate enough to have an operations team within your organization\nthat handles the bulk of the support role for you.\n\nHere an escalation process is highly recommended so that the operations team\nknows when and which teams to filter queries to.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/streamline-communication/operations-team.jpg\"\n     description=\"Communication from the product department, technology department, executives & stakeholders and users directly to the operations team. This team can escalate queries to the appropriate teams on an ad-hoc basis.\"\n%}\n\nIt is important to liaise with the operations team and guide them with incorrect\nescalations so that they can handle them more efficiently in the future.\n\nIf something changes in your system, they need to be aware of these changes if\nthere is an impact to the users or ways the systems are monitored.\n\nA ticketing system can be introduced or utilized to raise issues and get\nfeedback regarding the resolution of issues. Visibility to this system is\nessential as tickets can get lost in heaps of corporate emails.\n\n## Monitoring & feedback loops\n\nNo team can function optimally without appropriate monitoring in place.\n\nIt is essential to have your systems monitored with quick feedback loops so that\nyou know when something is down or failing. Some examples include:\n\n-   System health checks\n-   Product and service availability and uptime\n-   Dependency integration points are working\n-   Changes you have made have not affected other features or products\n    (automated regression test suite)\n\nWhen something does go down, dependent product teams need to be notified. This\napplies for when things are up and running again.\n\n## Reactive systems design\n\nYou could look into building your systems to be more\n[reactive](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) meaning that they respond in a\ntimely manner, stay responsive when dependencies fail, respond under varying\nloads, and are loosely coupled from its dependencies.\n\nWhen systems fail, your monitoring tools could notify the right people to get\nthe systems back up and running without hindering the user experience to a\nlarge extent.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nFighting fires is a tedious and stressful part of software development\nespecially in larger organizations with what seem to be millions of integration\npoints. Not many people know or understand the bigger picture.\n\nPeople can end up scrambling around trying to figure out what and why something\nbroke. When too much communication enters your team, you need to find ways to\nstreamline the communication process and find sustainable ways to proceed.\n\nThe world is not on your shoulders. Speak to your team, line manager,\nscrum master (or Agile coach), and product owner to get the support you need\nto make the product and operating the product a success.\n",

Many refer to such obstacles as red-tape.\n\nThis can be anything from proxy or network related constraints to unaligned\nenvironment configurations to corporate governance and change control.\n\nWhatever the red-tape is that you face, it can be really frustrating as it\nslows down or completely impedes progressing work into production.\n\nLuckily for you, corporates tend to have a lot of people. It is likely that they\nexperience or have experienced the same frustrations as you. This means you\nhave **a complete internal knowledge-base** that you can utilize to aid you.\nBuild relationships with these people. This is what I mean by red-tape allies.\n\nIf you are new to the corporate world or to the particular corporate\norganization, the red-tape and the amount of people can be overwhelming. Start\nby networking with your team and get them to introduce you to other people\nthat you can learn from. If you aren't the shy type, go introduce yourself.\n\nObviously it takes time to meet people, learn about the company, your product\nand how to overcome red-tape but you never have to feel stuck and alone.\n\n## Network\n\nGrow your network of people that can aid you with solving red-tape.\n\nStart networking with software developers from other teams. Drop in for a quick\nvisit to see how other teams do things or chat to them during lunch, grabbing a\ncup of coffee or while at the water cooler.\n\nIf you have remote teams, try video conferencing or chatting to them over\nwhatever medium it is that they may be using.\n\nInclude developer leads, line managers or other managers in your network.\nThey may or may not be directly involved with the team you are in.\n\nLeads and managers usually have the bigger picture in mind and can offer a lot\nof strategic insights that might aid you even more.\n\nIT and Security Engineers have a lot of insights to what is happening on the\ncompany network, with antivirus scans and the proxy servers. If you include\nthem in your personal network, you could gain insights and assistance that\ncould help you easily resolve issues.\n\nI've found networking with non-technical people to be advantageous. They can\ngive ideas and food-for-thought to certain obstacles you face. They can\nask you a bunch of thought-provoking questions so that they can try understand\nthe problem which could lead you on the right path.\n\n## Share ideas\n\nStart chatting to other people about things that frustrate you or impede your\nwork.\n\nIt's important to be objective so that you don't cling to your frustrations as\nit impedes the ability to find solutions. It's equally important that you\ndon't come across as offensive as people will shy away from you.\n\n**Listen** to suggestions and opinions objectively. People will be sharing their\npersonal experiences with you. They are not forcing you to do anything, even if\nit sounds that way.\n\nSo remember that it doesn't mean that you have to go and change everything in\nyour team. Simply extract useful information that you and your team can apply\nand keep the rest in mind.\n\nThe same mindset needs to be had when you share your newfound ideas with your\nteam. Try not to impose drastic changes that could unravel the balance your\nteam has. Try to suggest quick experiments that could give you the most gains\nto see if they will work.\n\nOur company has a monthly demo day where each team demonstrates the work they\nhave done in the last two sprints. This is an ideal platform to share how\nimpediments were improved or resolved by discussing how the team streamlined\ndifferent processes and what small experiments were introduced within the sprint.\n\nMistakes are also a great way to learn how not to do things. Gladly share them\nand learn through the mistakes of others.\n\n## Document\n\nShare your learnings with your team and try to document it on a central\nknowledge base whether it be an online Wiki, blog or Q&A platform. This can\nhelp others who face the same problems as you in the future.\n\nWhen others approach you with issues you have solved, gladly share your insights\nwith them.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nBuilding relationships with people outside your team gives you insights to how\nother people and teams are tackling different problems that your team may be \nexperiencing. Sometimes we get too close to a problem that we can't always\nsee the solution straightaway.\n\nHaving allies that are exposed to just as much red-tape as you can give you the\nconfidence and guidance you need within your organization thus minimizing\nyour frustrations.\n",

Pressure builds and hits the team from the outside like a ton\nof bricks.\n\nThis didn't happen here. Our stress was superficial and here's why:\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe had two stories which heavily relied on core components seeking immediate\ntechnical attention that wasn't planned for. We found tight coupling,\nduplication, unused and misplaced components across different assemblies.\n\nUs two developers discussed this and decided that it needs to be addressed.\nAs we are accountable for the product, we need to care about its\nquality. Also when something goes wrong, we need to know exactly when, where and\nhow it broke and these components weren't meeting these needs.\n\nWe knew it would take a bit of time to address so we motivated this change with\nour Product Owner and Tester. We highlighted the need to focus on the quality\nof the plumbing on these components and the problems it could potentially\nfix with troubleshooting problems users experience as we are always\nburned by this.\n\nMotivating technical changes with a Product Owner is a gray area as it is the\nprofessional duty of a developer to fix code rot and leave code in a better\ncondition than it was before. I don't dispute this but if the change may impact\nother commitments, the Product Owner **must** be in the know. as they need to\nmanage stakeholder expectations.\n\nIf we blindly entered this refactor without motivating this need in\nbusiness/product terms to our Product Owner, we would have jeopardized our\nsprint and destroyed trust.\n\n## Manage expectations\n\nAs the days went on we [Developers] were starting to stress a bit. This simple\nrefactor grew into a mountain of work that required a lot of focus.\n\nNo one was pushing us for status or progress updates because we made sure we\nhighlighted our progress and struggles during stand ups and throughout the day.\n\nMany technical queries entered our team which interrupted our focus. When\nwe communicated the situation and the need for focus, our Product Owner,\nScrum Master, Dev Lead and Tester really stepped up to alleviate the pressures\nby tackling the issues the best they could so that we could focus.\n\nYesterday we started showing how some bugs were resolved and how other enhancements\nwere automatically surfacing through this refactor. We were all getting really\nexcited but weren't out the woods yet.\n\nWe could feel the technical plumbing become more solid and product could see\nthe minor enhancements on the front end on our local environments.\n\nOur Product Owner suggested creating visibility for these changes so we created\nzero point stories in the sprint and increased our story points for the stories\nwe underestimated.\n\n## Confidence\n\nAfter many technical struggles, today we were victorious. Our blood sweat and\ntears entered our staging environment in a working condition and our stories\nstarted moving making our sprint look more balanced.\n\nWe would never have made it this far without our additional tests that we\nintroduced. As we branched off, we were rebasing, introducing changes,\ndiscarding changes and merging. Our test suite and new components really\nincreased our confidence.\n\nWe also made a point of writing the code in such a way that it would only impact\nthe stories we are currently working on. In next iterations we can slowly migrate\nother components when we touch on that code.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nOur stress was superficial because we took it upon ourselves to improve the\nquality of our codebase.\n\nEven though our burndown doesn't reflect so, this is one of the best sprints\nI've ever been a part of. The rainbow at the end of our storm sprint was that\nour team really pulled together to make a flat-lining storm of a sprint\nvictorious.\n\nHere's a summary of the factors contributing to our victory:\n\n-   We took ownership and accountability of the product and codebase\n-   We worked cohesively together driven by passion towards to the success of the product\n-   We admitted to mistakes that we made and learned from them\n-   We regularly communicated our progress, risks and issues we faced\n-   We worked and thought strategically keeping the team, business, product and\n    user's best interests at heart\n-   We got support because we asked for help\n-   We created visibility of the success that came from addressing our technical\n    debt\n\nThe bottom line is that when people are not in the know, teams can pull in\nall sorts of directions. **Communication is essential to minimize stress and\nget the support a team needs to be successful.** That is why our flat-lining\nsprint wasn't riddled by constant interruptions and panicked people.\n",

And when you breathe mindfully, that is mindfulness\n> of breathing. ~ [Thich Nhat Hanh](http://www.mindful.org/author/thich-nhat-hanh/)\n\nYesterday, I was introduced to\n**[five steps to minfulness](http://www.mindful.org/five-steps-to-mindfulness/)**,\na great post written by Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.\n\nDid you know that you can create a feeling of happiness in your day regardless\nof where you are, how you feel, what situation you are in or what time it is?\n\nI was in desperate need of a technique to help me as most days I feel like I\nam not in control of my days or emotions, so I decided to give these steps a try.\n\nI actually felt present in my day. I saw, listened and experienced my day like\nno other day before. I experienced a great day full of happy moments.\n\n| What I achieved                | Because of               |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |\n| I worked sustainably           | I was focused            |\n| I was stimulated               | I didn't multitask       |\n| I heard what people had to say | I actually listened      |\n| I felt productive              | I was completing tasks   |\n| I had better posture           | I was mindful of my body |\n| I remembered more than usual   | I was consciously doing  |\n| I smiled meaningfully          | I was truly content      |\n\nUsually I'd be wrapped up in so many thoughts that I'd end up creating a clutter\naround me. I'd forget where I put things down.\n\nThis clutter creates anxiety and I can rarely attend to it because I hardly\nhave enough time. When I do, I am too exhausted to care. This is physical\nevidence of the clutter going on in my mind.\n\nI struggle to finish tasks easily because _seemingly more important_ ones\ncreep up and I'd run around - mentally and physically - multitasking which\nresults in feeling scatterbrained.\n\nAs I was focused today, my mind was present. When I put something down, I put\nit down neatly. I didn't forget where I put it because I put it down\nconsciously. Both was a consequence of doing things with intent.\n\nWhen I got to work and sat at my table, in a few minutes my table was\neffortlessly clean and I had attended to more than I have ever been able to do\nin the past. **Everything I did was done with intent and slower than usual.**\n\n-   I learned that it takes time to make time. Rushing to get everything done only\n    creates a mental clutter in my mind that impedes clarity and insight.\n\n-   Doing things with intent in a focused manner naturally breaks me out of the\n    survival-mode I am so accustomed to and frees me from multitasking.\n\n-   If I can't get to everything in a day, then so be it. Practicing being mindful\n    has aided me in approaching my day in a more sustainable way while living in\n    the here and now.\n\n-   I felt like a got more out of my day (and time) because I was actually living\n    in the moment instead of in the past or future.\n\nThis practice is very rewarding, sustainable, keeps me calm and makes me happy.\n\n> You are caught in the past or in the future. You are not there in the present\n> moment, living your life deeply. That is forgetfulness. The opposite of\n> forgetfulness is mindfulness. ~ [Thich Nhat Hanh](http://www.mindful.org/author/thich-nhat-hanh/)\n",

Although\nthis applies to all aspects of life, dealing with the unknown only amplifies\nthe stresses that build.\n\nA mentor introduced me to these three questions I could ask myself (and write\ndown the answers to) when I find myself in a stressful situation\nwhere I can't predict the outcome:\n\n1.  What do I think is the worst possible realistic outcome of the situation?\n2.  How will I feel about it?\n3.  What will I do about it?\n\nI've seen the value of applying these questions both in my professional and\npersonal capacity.\n\nWhen I explore the absolute worst realistic outcome I can think of, I've\ngiven the situation deliberate thought and processed a way to deal with how I\nfeel about it and how I can overcome it.\n\n> I am an old man and I have known a great many troubles, but most of them\n> never happened. ~ Mark Twain\n\nIt's actually rare that the worst outcome will materialize so just by thinking\nabout it I am equipped to take on whatever comes my way without getting worked\nup about it.\n",

So what can turn someone into a professional driver or\n> programmer? What do you do to practice?\" ~\n> [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-code-kata/)\n\n## Benefits\n\nTo me the idea is not to become better at writing actual code but rather to\nbecome more familiar with your development toolbox.\n\nIf you are writing production code, and are hindered by your IDE or find\nyourself grabbing for the mouse to do the same thing over and over again, or\nare new to a concept then a Code Kata could help you optimize your workflow.\n\n-   Familiarize yourself with your tools (IDE, editor, keyboard).\n-   Experiment with features you don't usually get time to experiment with.\n-   Learn a new tool or language.\n-   Practice a new or alternate work flow, idea or concept like TDD, BDD, patterns,\n    refactoring, naming etc.\n-   Learn shortcut keys by unplugging your mouse.\n-   Practice different types of programming techniques or ways to solve the same\n    problem. Try not to use an if statement etc.\n-   Improve and optimize your speed and efficiency without worrying about the\n    logic behind the problem.\n\n## Getting started\n\nIt's a small, simple and fun exercise that you can do each day or weekly for\nabout 10 to 30 minutes depending on what you want to gain from it and your own\npersonal preference.\n\n-   You need to be in a space where you are not interrupted in that time.\n-   You need to be clear about what you want to strive for or achieve in your\n    sessions.\n-   Decide how long you want your session and start a timer so that you don't\n    go over.\n\nHere are some resources to help you get started with Code Katas:\n\n-   [Code Kata](http://codekata.com/) - Explore 21 different code katas by\n    Dave Thomas\n-   [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) - Train on katas from their website.\n-   Uncle Bob's\n    [Bowling Game Kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata)\n\n## Alternatives\n\n-   [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com) is a challenge-based training\n    platform for programmers where you can play with the hottest programming\n    topics. Solve games, code AI bots, learn from your peers, have fun.\n\n-   [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)\n    is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that\n    will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics\n    will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer\n    and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.\n\n-   [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) is a platform that allows you to\n    learn new languages in an interactive tutorial based interface so that you\n    don't have to install anything while you learn.\n\n-   Jeff Atwood provides some alternate [approachs](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-code-kata/)\n    to Code Katas through\n    -   [practice drills](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practicing-programming)\n        from Steve Yegge,\n    -   general recommendations outlined in [Teach Yourself Programming in\n        Ten Years](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html) by Peter Norvig, and\n    -   adds two of his one movements which including writing a blog and actively\n        participating in a notable open source project or three.\n\n## Trade-offs\n\nThe Programmers Stack Exchange community respond to a question titled [Drawbacks\nof Code Kata](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/138479/drawbacks-of-code-kata).\nSome responses are along the lines of:\n\n-   It's difficult to introduce in a work place\n-   You must actually try to improve in some sense\n-   It takes time\n-   Some people think it isn't worth the time it takes\n-   Some people find it boring\n-   You don't have a cool working product at the end\n\nIn 2014, John Sonmez wrote about his perspective as to [why he doesn't do\nCode Katas](https://hackhands.com/dont-code-katas/). He makes some interesting\npoints around achieving software development mastery although I don't think\nthat is the goal of a Code Kata. Regardless, you may be able to extract some\nuseful tips for mastery.\n",

I'd like to share the steps I\ntook to accomplish this, a little background story, some additional tips for\nwriting for developers and the social media activity I got from the article.\n\n## Steps\n\n1.  **Why?**\n    If you have an idea for a topic that could inspire or inspire others, then\n    you probably have your why. You could however be putting this on your own\n    blog. What is your why?\n\n2.  **Who do you want to write for?**\n    Find a website you really want to contribute to. This could be one of many\n    websites you admire and constantly read or follow. Make sure your topic is\n    closely knitted with the theme of their content.\n\n3.  **Find out how to contribute.**\n    You can read more about contributing by clicking on a\n    \"write for us\" or \"submit your <topic>\" link usually at the top of the page.\n    Not all websites are open for community contributions.\n\n4.  **Submit your topic.**\n    The contribution section will have more information about how you can\n    submit your topic. It's usually supported by one or two backing paragraphs\n    telling them how your article could help or inspire others or elaborate\n    more on your topic. The contribution section should give you more insights\n    into what they expect from your submission.\n\n5.  **Wait.**\n    You may need to wait for feedback. Possibly 2 to 4 weeks depending on their\n    process and guidelines.\n\n6.  **Your response, if any.**\n    If you get the thumbs up, be prepared to work hard as quality is important on\n    high-volume traffic sites. You may work closely with a writing editor on a\n    collaborative tool like Google Docs depending on their process. They will\n    give you all the information you need. I can't vouch for all websites but\n    I'm sure a response will come.\n\n7.  **Comments after publication.**\n    Be prepared to provide feedback to comments that come in once your article\n    has been published.\n\nIf you don't get the thumbs up, you could ask why it was declined, if they\ndidn't specify. You could try submit your topic to another website\nor alternatively write about it on your own blog. When you get a new great\nidea, simply try the steps again.\n\n**Tip:** Try not to blindly send topics to websites you admire without\nunderstanding the theme of their content. This could lead to your topic being\nrejected.\n\n## Background story\n\nI haven't been good with sharing my knowledge and experiences with the community\nthroughout my career. I always assumed my knowledge was mediocre or commonly\nknown.\n\nI'd tried blogging many times but felt directionless and judged myself\ntoo harshly. It was scary sharing my ideas, thoughts and code.\n\nI started reflecting on my career. One night I had this bright idea to share\nthe mistakes I have made, something personal that could hopefully inspire or\nhelp others.\n\nI wanted to get out of my comfort zone and submit the idea to\n[A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/), a website for people who make\nwebsites. It made sense as I am a web developer and the mistakes were in that\nline of work.\n\nI started by reading how I could write for them. I decided to send the title\nand a short description. The next day I had elaborated and sent the updated\ninformation.\n\nTwo weeks later I got a response back from them saying that they\nlove the topic and that we will be going forward with it. I almost fell out of\nmy bed when I read the email.\n\nThe article evolved after a few iterations while I was working closely with\nRose Weisburd — an editor at A List Apart. This was a first for me and the\nexperience was exhilarating.\n\n**I never thought it was something I could do. But I did it. And anyone can.**\n\nWhile the iterations were nearing an end, I started thinking about creating a\nblog that I would consistently contribute to. This is when Corporate Programmer\nwas born, thanks to a great [blogging course](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/)\nfrom John Sonmez.\n\nBy publishing at least three posts a week, I was able to bulk up my blog and\nenjoy writing and sharing my experiences in my own time on my own platform.\n\nWhen the article was published my Twitter account went wild. I didn't\nexpect this at all. And I had a great looking blog to link to from my author\nbio page.\n\nThe feedback I got was positive and inspiring. I never knew so many people would\nlike it or be able to relate to it that much. _Self doubt tends to do this to\na person._\n\n**It goes to show that we can easily overlook the importance of the information\nwe gather during our days on earth. Something you may consider small could\nhave a tremendous impact on someone else.**\n\nI was in awe when I Googled the title and searched for it on Twitter. There were\nso many references that weren't linked to my account but being shared.\nHow amazing.\n\nIs this something you would like to do? What is stopping you?\n\n## Writing for developers\n\nAlthough my article (and blog) isn't very technical, my audience is.\n\nIf you want to learn more about sharing your ideas with the software development\ncommunity, WriteSpeakCode recorded a panel that shares some great tips that can\nhelp you.\n\nCheck out the\n[story](https://storify.com/chiuki/writing-for-developers-panel-2016),\ncomplete with the video,\ncompiled by [Chiu-Ki Chan](https://twitter.com/chiuki).\n\n## Social media activity\n\n<div class=\"storify\"><iframe src=\"//storify.com/cbillowes/finding-opportunities-in-the-mistakes-we-make/embed?header=false&border=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"750\" frameborder=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe><script src=\"//storify.com/cbillowes/finding-opportunities-in-the-mistakes-we-make.js?header=false&border=false\"></script><noscript>[<a href=\"//storify.com/cbillowes/finding-opportunities-in-the-mistakes-we-make\" target=\"_blank\">View the story \"Finding Opportunities in the Mistakes We Make\" on Storify</a>]</noscript></div>\n",

I wish to boost my overall sense of wellbeing by living a\n> more fulfilling life day-to-day.\n\nI decided it was time to consciously unpack why I feel overwhelmed:\n\n-   The city feels rushed. The negative effects of traffic while people are\n    rushing to get somewhere on time can be a terrible start to ones day.\n\n-   At work we may be bombarded by emails, meetings, changes in priorities,\n    distractions, work we couldn't complete the day before, deadlines and crises\n    that need to be dealt with. We have so much work to get done that it's\n    counter-intuitive to take breaks. Multitask!\n\n-   We are overloaded by information from all over the world and it's readily\n    accessible to us any time of the day.\n\n-   Being exposed to how other people advertise their lives on social media makes\n    us question our own sense of achievement and can leave us feeling overwhelmed\n    and sometimes even depressed.\n\n-   Our devices distract us through notifications, messages and calls.\n\n-   In software, everything keeps [changing](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/07/27/TheChurn.html).\n    There is so much to keep in mind, learn, troubleshoot and figure out. People\n    look to us for answers to questions that we _sometimes_ don't have.\n\n-   We have personal commitments too like going to the gym, meeting with friends,\n    attending meetups, servicing our vehicles etc. Our weekends can easily get\n    booked out causing anxiety as it could be considered our \"me-time\" or \"down-time\".\n\nIt's no wonder at the end of the day we are exhausted. There are only 24 hours\nin each day of which 8 of them we need for proper sleep.\n\n## Epiphany\n\nI don't want to live each day waiting for retirement, wishing for a vacation,\nwaiting for payday or celebrating the start of a weekend.\n\nOver the years I've had many thoughts of retreating to the outskirts of the\ncountry, getting off the grid or going to live a minimalist life on an island\nsomewhere. Those thoughts gave my mind a false sense of peace in a reality\nthat never materialized.\n\nI realized that I needed to find ways to deal with the overwhelming nature of my\ncurrent lifestyle without escaping the city and I believe it's possible.\n\nSince I have started thinking about this, my perspective is actively collecting\ninformation to improve. The aim is simple. I wish to boost my\n**overall sense of wellbeing by living a more fulfilling life day-to-day**\nin an environment that is rushing around me.\n\nBy doing so I believe that it will improve my:\n\n-   Productivity & performance\n-   Self confidence\n-   Energy levels\n-   Time management\n-   Decision making\n-   Interactions with others\n-   Sleep\n\n## My experiment\n\nAs there is so much happening I know I am not in control of everything. For that\nwhich I am in control of, I can try to take small steps toward this aim.\n\nI started by practicing [mindfulness](/blog/a-mindful-day-of-happiness/) just\nover a month ago. I've slowed things down quite a bit.\n\nSomething interesting I've noticed about me is that I can push through a great\ndeal of work. Once the end has been reached and things slow down again, I get\nsick and feel exhausted. I think that's where I am now.\n\nAs I'm still figuring things out I am not concerned but I would like to document\nthe progress and things I am learning through this journey.\n\nI must say that although I am feeling exhausted, I don't feel as overwhelmed as\nI used to. Many of the things that overwhelmed me were side-effects of a mind\nrunning wild with thoughts and getting sucked into the rush around me.\n\n## My mindset\n\nThe moment I look at something as a goal my mind believes there is an end to it\nand then I can tackle the next best thing.\n\nInstead I think of sustainable living as a choice of lifestyle with **deliberate\nyet minimal effort** as to not overwhelm myself further.\n\nI am trying to work on my routine. Throughout the last 6 months or so, these\npractices have become a part of me and aid me in my new journey:\n\n-   I leave for work and head home outside of peak traffic times to avoid\n    unnecessary frustrations.\n\n-   I am practicing **[journaling](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/6-ways-journaling-will-change-your-life.html)**\n    where I write about my day to find out more about myself, allow myself time\n    to reflect and process my thoughts.\n\n-   I am training myself to singletask instead of multitask to improve the quality\n    of work I deliver as well as my mental wellbeing.\n\n-   When I am stressed, I pause, take a few deep breaths to calm myself down.\n\n-   I make sure to meditate each day for a minimum of 10 minutes using the\n    Headspace or Buddify apps.\n\n-   I see a counselling psychologist monthly for coaching in both my career and\n    personal life.\n\n-   I attend an hour of Pilates and hour of Yoga class each week for exercise, to\n    strengthen my core, improve my posture and for better headspace.\n\n-   I am reading up about Behavioral Science and how it can improve my working\n    life.\n\n-   I observe and converse with others to learn more about life and how others\n    are coping.\n\n-   I try not to look at my phone all the time. When I am walking, I don't read\n    or reply to messages. I try to allocate a few seconds every now and then to\n    attend to messages. I've also found comfort in muting certain notifications\n    that never need immediate attention.\n\n-   When I find myself rushing, I slow down and walk at a normal pace.\n    Surprisingly I am always [on time](https://medium.com/@cbouwer/adopting-the-practice-of-mindfulness-a8c5b6b63ae7).\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nIt's not easy. I find many challenges and I don't always get it right. I am not\ngetting enough sleep and I am feeling a bit ill but I don't belittle myself.\nI just keep trying and it's working.\n\nI am seeing signs of improvement. I am more approachable and I am getting more done\nthan before. My days feel more meaningful and already this is more sustainable\nthan my drifting \"what the hell did I do today?\" type of days.\n\nAdmittedly my blog took a bit of strain as I decided some downtime was required\nbut so be it.\n\nI am eager to know your thoughts and perspective on this topic. Please feel\nfree to share with me.\n\nHappy living!\n\n## Resources\n\n-   [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) is a gym membership for the mind.\n    A course of guided meditation, delivered via an app or online.

No more Wikipedia. No more READMEs. No more StackOverflow.\nNo more API references and tutorials.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    Don&#39;t take what you know for granted. Someone else may not know what\n    you know.\n  </p>&mdash; Clarice Bouwer (@cbillowes)\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cbillowes/status/779058105439182852\">\n    September 22, 2016\n  </a>\n</blockquote>\n\nDocumentation is a very broad term and has a bad stigma to it. As it can apply\nto anything from the enterprise to the application—what is written today can be\nstale or incorrect tomorrow.\n\nThe code repository is something you have control over. It contains the\napplication which translates the business needs to code.\n\nYour repository is meaningless if someone else needs to work on it and can't\neven get setup. Use your README to help other software developers and assume\nthey know nothing about the project. Here's what I think could help contribute\nto a great README file:\n\n## Overview\n\n### Introduction\n\n-   A brief introduction to the repository summed up in one or two explanatory\n    sentences.\n-   If it's a component of a bigger project, mention it and reference the other\n    components.\n-   If the project has a vision add it.  \n\n### Architecture\n\nIs there a simplified architectural diagram that can quickly highlight the\noverall architecture at a glimpse? This changes over time so extensive\ndocumentation is probably not an option unless it can be automated or there is\na role where someone needs to keep it updated.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nYour project is probably referencing some dependencies. In .NET all Nuget\npackages and their dependencies sit in the root of the same folder. This makes\nit difficult to differentiate what was explicitly referenced and why.\n\nIf future developers are unfamiliar with the packages, the chances of cleaning\nunnecessary packages up later is slim to none.\n\nList the dependencies that you have explicitly referenced and mention why.\n\n### Environments\n\n-   What environments exists for this application?\n-   How can these environments be accessed?\n-   What is the purpose of each environment and how does it tie into the build\n    pipeline?\n-   What are the different integration points so that I know where things can fail?\n-   Do I need to know anything specific about each environment?\n\n### Commit guidelines\n\nIf you have a [standard](/blog/importance-of-git-history/#useful-messages)\nfor commit messages then state how commits should be written for new features,\nbug fixes, improvements and refactoring in this repository.\n\nWhat other information needs to be present in the message; a link to the ticket\nnumber or the reasoning behind a change?\n\n## Getting setup\n\n-   What tools do you suggest I use while I'm getting familiar with the code?\n-   What software (and versions) do I need to install to get it to work?\n-   Do I need to be on a specific network?\n-   Do I need host entries for the application to run properly?\n-   Is there something I should know about the proxy?\n-   Is any of this automated in a VM or container script that I can use, and how?\n-   How do I run the application? What dependency modules or services need to be\n    up before I can run it properly?\n\n## Testing\n\n-   What testing and mocking frameworks are being used?\n-   Do I need a specific test runner to run the tests?\n-   What type of tests exist in the application? Where do I locate them (if it's\n    not in a standard place)?\n-   What is the strategy for running longer running tests in the CI?\n-   How is the UI tested and where are those tests?\n\n## Deployment pipeline\n\n-   Where can I access the deployment pipeline?\n-   What is the process?\n-   Do I need to know anything specific about it?\n-   Who can deploy to production? (Automated / Manual / Restricted access?)\n-   How is production deployed to? What must be done before it can deployed to?\n    (Governance requirements etc)\n-   Is there something that must happen after deploying to production?\n\n## Knowledgebase\n\nAll the knowledge you accumulate during your journey with this repository is\nlost (only available in your mind) when you leave. What other knowledge can\nyou share to help future developers on the project to avoid the same mistakes\nbeing made in the future.\n\n-   Are there any caveats to know about?\n-   Do you have a history of issues that you faced with solutions to those\n    problems?\n-   How does one troubleshoot?\n-   Are there support tools or applications I need to know about?\n-   What is the escalation procedure for common problems?\n-   Is there a ticketing system?\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nThe next time you think that documenting something will take too much time,\nthink how you would feel if you were in the next person's shoes. Too scared to\nmake changes, anxious about deploying and downright frightened to even look\nat the code.\n\nMake the world a better place. Contribute to the README and write about what\nyou learn so that others can benefit and start innovating instead of struggling\ntoo much.\n\n**Note**: This may appear verbose but could be broken down into separate pages\nor linked out to other references. It doesn't have to be extensive but it\nmust be good enough to get someone up and running especially if the person is\nnew to the company or your team.\n\nIf your documentation does become extensive it could highlight problems within\nyour solution that could be reflected on for improvements.\n\n* * *\n\n## References\n\n-   [A curated list of awesome README](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)\n-   [How to write a good README](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304863/how-to-write-a-good-readme)\n    from StackOverflow\n-   [The Importance of Git History](/blog/importance-of-git-history/#useful-messages),\n    writing useful messages\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n",

This person doesn't\nhave to be well known, but to you this person is doing amazing things.\nThings you probably don't think you can do or achieve. Then consider the\nfollowing questions.\n\n-   How often do you compare yourself to this person?\n-   Do you feel inferior to this person?\n-   Do you want to be more like this person?\n-   Do you think this person just naturally succeeds?\n-   Do you think that you can be as successful as this person?\n-   Why do you consider this person to be successful?\n-   How often do you consider the struggles and challenges this person faces?\n\n## Subjective perspective\n\nYour point of view is influenced by your personal feelings and opinions\nwhich accumulate and adapt throughout your life based on the circumstances,\nenvironment and experiences that you have been exposed to.\n\nWe all see the world through our own eyes so we experience things differently.\nHave you ever been in a meeting where two people had polar opposite experiences?\nOne thought the meeting to be extremely valuable while the other a complete waste\nof time?\n\nThe way you see yourself could be completely different to the way others see you.\nYou know yourself inside out. Your thoughts, feelings, fears, struggles. The\npeople around you are exposed to what you project.\n\nKeep in mind that when you look at people you deem successful, then you\nonly see what they are projecting.\n\nWith that said, how often do you\n\n-   consider yourself to be successful?\n-   recognize when you have succeeded at something?\n-   appreciate the effort you put in and celebrate the win?\n\n## Imposter Syndrome\n\nWikipedia says that Imposter Syndrome doesn't have a standard definition,​\nbut explains that it as a 'concept describing​ **high-achieving individuals** ​\nwho are marked by an​ **inability to internalize their accomplishments** ​and\nhave a​ **persistent fear of being exposed as a \"fraud.\"**'\n\nIt can be debilitating when the experiences are intense. Unfortunately many people\nsuffer from it and don't even realize it. The more we talk about it, the more\nwe can create awareness and help each other out.\n\nI [wrote](/blog/the-imposter-within/) about it, shared it on Reddit on\n[/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5cpaty/ive_had_a_lot_of_problems_with_imposter_syndrome/),\nthen someone else shared it [/r/programmingcirclejerk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/5ct7sx/imposter_syndrome_part_%E2%84%95_or_how_i_stopped/),\nI was interviewed on a [podcast](http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-202-clarice-bouwer-leaving-comfort-behind)\nand then I [spoke](/blog/rubyfuza-2017-conference) about it at the [Rubyfuza 2017 Conference](http://www.rubyfuza.org/)\nin Cape Town.\n\nThe post I wrote was successful. It gained a lot of traction through the Reddit\npost which I didn't expect. Honestly, it freaked me out. I got flamed and\ncomplimented and it sparked a series of events that I didn't anticipate.\n\nIt took me a week to write the post. I was scared to publish it because I was\nexposing a vulnerable side of myself. I had doubts but I shared it on Reddit\nbecause I wanted to create awareness regardless of how I felt.\n\nThen Dave contacted me to do the podcast and that scared me. I procrastinated.\nWhen I finally did have the interview I had mixed emotions although he thought\nit was fantastic. When it was published I really struggled to listen to it.\n\nI have a terrible fear of [public speaking](/blog/coping-with-fears-of-public-speaking/)\nbut I submitted the talk to Rubyfuza because it's a fear I want to address and\nagain I want to keep raising awareness on this topic.\n\nI struggled from the day the talk was accepted. I had panic attacks and\ndidn't believe that I would be able to deliver the speech at all.\n\nAfter the talk, I received numerous compliments. I was told that I\ndidn't appear nervous, I delivered it quite well and people resonated with the\ntopic.\n\nThe reality was that I wanted to hurl. I was shaking. I wanted to run away.\nI doubted my content, my abilities and thought that my voice sounded like\nBatman at times.\n\nNow, if I was someone else looking at what I have achieved in the last year I'd\nprobably think \"Wow! How brave and successful. I wish I could be more like her.\"\n\nBut I am me. I know all the pain, suffering, anxiety, fears, worries, concerns,\ndoubts, doom and gloom I went through on this journey. **This tends to negate the\nability for me to identify and internalize my accomplishments.** At least that\nseems to be the trend that I see in myself.\n\nSince I have identified that I have Imposter Syndrome, named it and unpacked\nit, I have become more aware of my thoughts and behavior. I try to be less harsh\non myself and celebrate my wins. I don't always get it right but at least\nit's a step in the right direction.\n\n## Compared to others\n\nI used to put people I deem successful on pedestals. I didn't believe I would\nbe able to achieve what they could yet I would compare myself to them which\nmade me feel bad about myself.\n\nI've since learned that I can compare myself to other people to see how I can improve\ncertain areas and skills in my life. As long as I remember that I am merely\ncomparing outcomes on an outer level.\n\nI am not always exposed to the effort and pain involved in the process prior to\nthe outcome.\n\n> The reason why we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind\n> the scenes with everyone else's highlight reel. ― Steven Furtick\n\nSo, now I know that when I look at successful people, I am only seeing half\nthe picture. I didn't consider that these people are ordinary human\nbeings who struggle - just like I do.\n\nThe moment this clicked, it broke down a barrier of self-limiting beliefs.\n\nWe can cautiously compare ourselves to others as a means of healthy competition and\nmeasurement. We can avoid it if it invokes negative effects like self-doubt,\nlow self-esteem and depression.\n\n## Expose the fear\n\nScott Hansleman spoke at the [DeveloperUG](https://www.meetup.com/DeveloperUG/)\nmeetup on Thursday 9 February. For 25 years\nhe has been struggling with [Type 1 Diabetes](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ThePromisingStateOfDiabetesTechnologyIn2016.aspx)\nand he is trying to tackle the problem with software. He also hinted at the\nfears he has of talking in front of an audience. I really appreciated him\nopenly sharing his struggles.\n\nThe behind the scenes of any successful individual can be quite messy. It's\nentangled with doubt, fear and struggles.\n\nFear can hold us back from doing amazing things and experiencing what life has\nto offer us. We all have fears and we should talk about it.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nIf we succeed in something, talking about the fears and struggles that happened\nprior to the outcome can expose others to a completely different perspective\nwhich could be quite empowering.\n\nIf we have these conversations and understand that it is not just us who feel\nscared and vulnerable, then we can cultivate a culture of bravery within our\nindustry and encourage people to get out of their shells.\n\nThis can lead to more valuable perspectives and experiences shared in our\ncommunity.\n",

It's how you use them, that may cost you.\" - KushandWizdom\n\nHow often do you listen to yourself when you speak? Not just hear your own voice\nbut **actually listen to the words that you use**.\n\nDo you carefully choose the words you use?\nThis can be in ordinary conversations, debates, heated arguments or even in the\nway you describe yourself.\n\nI struggle to choose my words wisely. I speak freely and sometimes I fail to\nproperly convey what I am trying to say. It's something I am actively trying to\nwork on which is why I am writing about it.\n\nThe language you use to describe your thoughts, feelings, circumstances and\nexperiences can ignite certain emotions in yourself and others. These emotions\nrange in the spectrum of positive and negative.\n\nIn certain cases it can be quite damaging and toxic (overly negative) or\ndelusional or blinding (overly positive) to a work environment. Therefore,\nit's important to consider the affects the words you use have on yourself and\nothers.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    Emotion reacts to language. So be careful what you say to others.\n    Be even more careful what you say to yourself.\n  </p>&mdash; Tim Kight (@TimothyKight)\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimothyKight/status/798865426176507904\">\n    November 16, 2016\n  </a>\n</blockquote>\n\n## Absolute language\n\n> ...But the human tongue is a beast that few can master.\n> It strains constantly to break out of its cage, and if it is not tamed,\n> it will run wild and cause you grief. ~ Unknown\n\nAs I have been experiencing [Imposter Syndrome](/blog/the-imposter-within/)\nI came to realize that I have a voice inside my head,​ and that voice can be\nreally mean.​ It sometimes puts me down and I believe it.​\n\nIt's like having the voice of\n[Marvin the robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_(character))\nfrom Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy inside my head - ​only less funny.​\n\nWhen I first [spoke](/blog/rubyfuza-2017-conference/) about my experiences of\nImposter Syndrome I used absolute language to describe it.\n\nWhen we use terms like _always, never, everyone, no one, constantly, none,\nanything, everything, nothing_ and\nso forth, we describe things that have **no exceptions**. That's simply the way\nit is.\n\n-   There is no ...\n-   Everyone is ...\n-   No one is ...\n-   They always ...\n-   We are constantly ...\n\nWe are probably just trying to convey the intensity of the thing that we are\ndescribing through the usage of absolute language because that is how we are\nfeeling at the time.\n\nBut what is the reality really? Do we take the time to pause and logically think\nit through - or are we driven by an emotional response at that time? We are\nhuman though after all.\n\nThings are rarely absolute and if we get sucked into the abyss of speaking in\nabsolutes, we are blinded by contradicting truths. Not only do we believe\nwhat we say but we affect the perception of others too.\n\n> Be careful with your words. Once they are said, they can be only\n> forgiven, not forgotten. ~ Unknown\n\n## Perspective\n\nWhen you wake up in a bad mood, have you noticed how the universe continues to\nthrow curve balls your way? Negative events compound throughout the day which\nsimply fuels to your building frustrations until you burst at the seams.\n\nWhen you wake up in an exceptionally good mood, have you noticed how you let\ncertain negative things that happen to you slip by without hindering on it?\n\nHave you ever been in a meeting where you noticed two polar opposite effects?\nSome people found the meeting super productive while some people found the\nmeeting a complete waste of time? While others found the meeting just okay?\n\nHave you become more attuned to what that one person has kept telling you and\nmade a concrete case to support their hypotheses?\n\nWhen you are in a particular mood or mindset, you are most likely more sensitive\nto things surrounding that mood or mindset - a sense of\n[confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).\n\n> The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a\n> way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses, while giving\n> disproportionately less consideration to alternative possibilities.\n> ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) on Confirmation\n> Bias\n\nAsk yourself, \"is it really as bleak and negative as I believe it to be?\" In the\nsame light, \"is it really as positive and awesome as it seems?\"\n\nFrom what perspective are you describing this thing? Have you questioned or\nscrutinized the thing you are talking about? Are you influenced by how\nyou are currently feeling? Should you wait a bit before you passionately talk\nabout it?\n\nI don't think anything is ever black and white. Surely there is a gray area to\nmost of the things we perceive.\n\nHow will you describe this thing if you were in a different mood such as\nhappier or more content?\n\nWhat you feel today is not necessarily how you will feel tomorrow. Words can\ndamage relationships and the perspective of yourself.\n\nThat doesn't mean you can't talk about it. It just means that you need to be\nconscious of the vocabulary used to convey the message in your current stete\nof mind.\n\n> Be mindful when it comes to your words. A string of some that don't mean much\n> to you, may stick with someone else for a lifetime. ~ Rachel Wolchin\n\n## Bigger picture\n\nDo you have enough information to make the conclusions that you are making\nright now? Is there a bigger part of the picture that you are not exposed to or\nnot seeing in your current state of mind?\n\nBe aware of making absolute conclusions and sticking to them when you aren't\naware of the bigger picture. Your perspective should be variable to the\ninformation you gather from this bigger picture over time.\n\nLet that reflect in the words that you use.\n\n> Handle them carefully, for words have more power than atom bombs.\n> ~ Pearl Strachan Hurd\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nI fall victim to using absolute language, my words reflect my current state of\nmind and I am not always aware of the bigger picture.\n\nWhen I am negative my tone tends to be negative and the same goes for positive.\n\nNow that I am conscious of it, I can try my best to influence the way I\nspeak. Not only will this have an impact on those around me but it will affect\nthe way I perceive myself.\n\nI believe that this is essential for the culture within an organization and how\nyou perceive yourself. Negativity is toxic and can spread like a virus.\n\nBe conscious of the words you use to explain your thoughts, feelings,\ncircumstances and experiences. If you get it wrong, don't be hard on yourself\nand don't ground yourself on the beliefs you speak of. Let them be variable\nwhile you keep building that bigger picture.\n\n* * *\n\n## Additional material\n\n-   [26 Brilliant Quotes on the Super Power of Words](http://www.inc.com/peter-economy/26-brilliant-quotes-on-the-super-power-of-words.html)\n    from Inc.com\n-   [3 Reasons Why We Should Be Careful When Using Absolutes](http://www.mtnuniversal.com/blogs/3-reasons-why-we-should-be-careful-when-using-absolutes)\n    from MTN Universal\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n",

Thanks for that one.\n\nOkay, I really feel I need to deep dive into this topic to make my\nintentions clear. It is common knowledge yet subtly and very challenging to\napply in both personal and professional relationships.\n\nSo why did I choose a depressed lady sitting in the corner of her room moping\nfor the hero of this post? Well...\n\n-   If you are a people-pleaser, you want to keep everyone around you happy. This\n    isn't possible as we know. People like different things and behave differently\n    in the same situation to others. This may unsettle you especially in conflict.\n\n-   If you are someone who wants to get things done and notice that people are\n    working too meticulously or what you may deem to be \"snails-pace\", you may\n    get frustrated.\n\n-   If you are methodical and meticulous, you may feel anxious around someone\n    who is rushing you or hounding you for deadlines or progress status updates.\n\nYou get my point. No matter who you are, there will be some form of conflict\ncontributed by an external factor that you cannot control. This can make us\nsad and could lead to depression.\n\nYou may feel the need to walk into a building and tell people exactly how they\nneed to act and work in order to create synergy for you. Effectively this could\ncause chaos for them. Granted a company culture where people buy into is\nmost likely an effective umbrella of action-oriented behavior but what about on\na personal level?\n\n**You cannot change other people.** You can't change the way they think, what\nthey believe, how they act or what they say. It's just not possible.\n\nYou can share insights and influence others through your behavior but they\nchoose how they react and interpret what you do and say.\n\n**This is why change starts with you.** It doesn't mean you are going to change\nthe world. It just means that you change your world.\n\n-   You decide how to perceive what is happening around you.\n-   You get to choose what impacts you (broadly) and how.\n-   You have control over how you react to other's words and behavior.\n-   You decide what consequences and trade-offs you are willing to take for\n    whatever decision or situation that arises.\n-   You become the **creator of your life instead of fall victim to society**.\n\nEasy? No. Possible? Yes - with a lot of hard work and dedication. Have I mastered\nthis? No. I am struggling my backside off trying to implement this in my life,\nwhich is why I write about it. To remind me and share what I have learned with\nothers.\n\nGandhi has [10 Rules for Changing the World](http://www.dailygood.org/story/466/gandhi-s-10-rules-for-changing-the-world-henrik-edberg/):\n\n1.  Change yourself\n2.  You are in control.\n3.  Forgive and let it go.\n4.  Without action you aren’t going anywhere.\n5.  Take care of this moment.\n6.  Everyone is human.\n7.  Persist.\n8.  See the good in people and help them.\n9.  Be congruent, be authentic, be your true self.\n10. Continue to grow and evolve.\n\nThe road to self-discovery is a long-winded topsy-turvy journey. I've been on\nthis journey for a while now and have written much on it.

Yes, this is maybe great advice until it becomes debilitating and\nyou falter under the pressures of this \"anomaly\".\n\n## Identify your limits\n\nI know this because I've succumbed to it. That is why I believe that it is\nimportant to know your limits.\n\nYou won't know if you don't try though. So go ahead and try. If it does cause\nsuch intense anxiety and debilitates you to the point of no return, you've\nmost likely reached a limit and know to avoid it for next time.\n\nYou can choose to follow through or escape the situation. The choice is yours\nfor the making - no one else's.\n\n### Is it worth my while?\n\nAsk yourself if you can really cope with this or if you need to back out:\n\n-   Which is more detrimental to me?\n-   What is the impact on my lifestyle, relationships and wellbeing?\n-   What are the consequences of both?\n-   Are there trade-offs or compromises that can be made?\n-   Is it just fear or real debilitation in my day-to-day functioning?\n\nIf it becomes so debilitating you may end up misusing or turning to mood altering\nsubstances, become obsessive and create unhealthy relationships.\nThis is what you want to avoid.\n\nThe most [debilitating experience](/blog/the-fear-behind-the-scenes/)\nI can share is speaking in front of an audience\nwhere I was filmed in a room with about 200 people. I now know, although I did\ndo it, that I will most likely not do public speaking on that level again.\n\n## Say no\n\nThis is a hard one, especially for a people-pleaser who takes on more than they\ncan chew. If you can't do something, you are not compelled to do it. Just\nsay no.\n\nBe the **FIRST beneficiary** for anything you do. If you are not benefiting from\na particular task, function or activity then you are losing your precious\ntime you have on this earth.\n\n-   You need to put yourself first.\n-   Understand your roles and responsibilities.\n-   Know your capabilities and strengths.\n-   Avoid burnout and being overwhelmed.\n\nSaying no gives you a way out of doing something outside of your limits.\n\n## Assertive demands\n\nSometimes you need to make demands. This could be something drastic as a salary\nadjustment, asking a colleague to stop showing up late for important meetings\nor something as simple as getting green sticky notes to help your\nproductivity.\n\nWhatever your demand is you can vigilantly communicate them without regret or\nguilt. Express your point of view while respecting the rights and beliefs of\nthe other person. This form of communication does not offer a no response but\na compromise can be made. It can help you boost your self-esteem and respect\nwith others.\n\nAssertive demands can help you manage people who often push you to do\nthings outside of your limits. You will be able to sternly but respectfully\ncommunicate the reasoning behind the lack of enthusiasm you do not share with\nregards to the situations and activities in question.\n\n## Boundaries\n\nDraw invisible lines where things make you feel inferior, uncomfortable or\n\"dirty\". There are probably other reasons for creating boundaries but the point\nis to communicate these boundaries and have consequences for the person\noverstepping a boundary - not empty threats. Push back or you'll be taken\nadvantage of.\n\nThese boundaries tied to your limits can help you identify where you wish to\ndraw the line personally with certain situations and activities. It can also\nhelp you manage the expectations of others who want you to do things you know\nyou cannot achieve without falling apart.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nI still choose to live outside my comfort-zone. I don't know many of my limits\nyet I do tend to push myself quite far. I have come to learn that I need to\nput my needs before my aspirations and successes as to not burn out and\nover extension.\n",

This\ndesperation has left me exhausted as I a played a cyclic game.\nI tormented myself because [purpose](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Apurpose)\nis **a person's sense of resolve or determination** and I felt I had none.\n\nWhile talking to a very good friend of mine, I came to realize that I want to\n**intentionally contribute in order to add value**.\n\nWell now, there's a bunch of complicated and overloaded words that require\nsome unpacking. At least it's more elaborate than _purpose_. Each statement\nin the unpacking process requires its own **why** and **what does it mean to\nme** in order to get to the bottom of our complex desires, or at least get\nclose enough to fulfillment.\n\nI had an epiphany a few weeks ago. What's the point of finding a purpose if I\ndon't know who I am? I need to discover myself first - a journey I've been on\nfor quite some time now. Maybe that is my purpose? Who knows.\n\nThe information I wish to share with you today, is information I gathered during\na self-healing process on my road to self-discovery.\n\n## Personal identity\n\n> No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may.\n> We ourselves must walk the path. ~ Buddha\n\nAs much as I kick and scream and tantrum, life is just going to keep happening to me.\nNature doesn't stop living when I am happy or when I am sad. The world just keeps\nturning and people just keep _peopling_.\n\nI can really start to listen to life. I can see it's story as it happens to me. I can\nfigure it out day by day and decide what it is that I want that will make me\nhappy or improve my sense of self-worth.\n\nSure life can really suck and as I know I can't control it and it doesn't care\nabout my logic or rationality, I can just let it happen to me. Accept it.\n\nI know I have the capacity to go anywhere and do whatever I want.\nI just need to live with consequences of whatever actions I choose. Are the\nconsequences destructive or rewarding? Is the choice feasible? A quick\nrationalization hardly does any harm.\n\nI'm so sucked in by my self-limiting beliefs and poor perspective that I don't\nrealize that I am in control of my life, my thoughts, my feelings and my behavior.\nI have power over me - even though I rarely believe it.\n\n## Suffering\n\nWe get hurt by people, circumstances and all the things that hurt us that are\noutside of our control. This leads to suffering...\n\n> Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.\n> Hate leads to suffering. ~ Yoda (George Lucas)\n\nWhen we are in the dark side (which is neither good nor bad), it becomes hard\nto realize that people act differently within their\nown parameters of limitations, insecurities, needs, finances, concerns, emotions,\nenvironments and circumstances. This is when we may experience unhealthy levels\nof fear, anger, hurt, sadness, pain and suffering.\n\nWe can spiral downward into a chaotic emotional mess if we allow it to happen.\nSometimes we are not aware of these parameters because we are the hero's or lead\nactors/actresses in our own lives.\n\nThis can be confusing. Understanding the logic but implementing in action are\ntwo different things. In the heat of the moment it is easy to lose control\nand lash out as an emotional defense.\n\n> You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger.\n> ~ Buddha\n\nI learned that I need to heal my perception of the people who have hurt me.\nI need to **heal the person within** me.\n\"I love you. I forgive you. I thank you. I am sorry.\"\n\nWe all have our own stories to tell. We desire healing at an emotional level. We\ncan start by being compassionate and caring. Give to others rather than hoping\nto get something back.\n\n## In the moment\n\n> Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind\n> on the present moment. ~ Buddha\n\nThe past is something that cannot be changed, the future is influenced by the\nchoices and actions that you make in the present moment.\n\nTo balance who we are we need to fulfil some needs which are independent of\ntime and space (place / circumstances / environment)\n\n-   Acceptance\n-   Contentment\n-   Excitement\n-   Happiness\n-   Health\n-   Love\n-   Peace\n-   Stability\n-   Success\n-   Wealth\n\nAs we require mental nourishment, we can find it through\n[Mindfulness](/blog/a-mindful-day-of-happiness/) practices by being present\nin the moment and allowing thoughts to come and go with acceptance and without\njudgement.\n\n## Outcome\n\n> What we think, we become. ~ Buddha\n\nYour mindset is powerful. You have the power to decide how you will feel in\na situation. You should be aware of the circumstances and decide how to act.\n\n-   What are the dangers of the situation?\n-   What are the consequences of my actions?\n-   Will it make me depressed or not depressed?\n\n### Depressed\n\nIf we choose to be depressed about something we tend to blame. We become a\n**victim**. Other people are accused and held responsible for our thoughts\nand feelings. _They_ did this to me. _They_ could have handled the situation\nbetter.\n\n### Not depressed\n\nIf we choose not to let the situation get us down we can own the situation.\nWe become the **creator**. This makes us a facilitator of our own destiny.\nWe realize that we are not responsible for anyone's thoughts and feelings other\nthan our own.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\n> Today you are You, that is truer than true.\n> There is no one alive who is Youer than You. ~ Dr. Seuss\n\nIt is important to discover who you are. You need mental nourishment and to look\nafter yourself.\n\nBe aware of your situations and how you wish to react. Set personal boundaries\nfor people around you. You can choose to give in spite of the situation but\nbe aware of the circumstances. **Transcend the situation.**\n\nBe mindful and live in the moment instead of dwelling on the past or future.\n",

My journey of self-discovery and healing.\nIt's a life-long journey and sometimes it's a real battle. Yes, it becomes\nabsolutely exhausting. I struggle - so many times, yet I push through as best\nI can. I try.\n\nOften I find myself in conversation giving insights or advice that could actually\nbe benefiting me directly. I have _WOAH!_ moments of epiphanies where I realize that I have\nso many of the answers to challenges that I face yet struggle to incorporate them\ninto my own life. Why? Maybe it's because:\n\n-   I am not yet ready myself\n-   Probably because it's not that simple\n-   I don't fully understand how I can implement it\n-   I am scared or too tired to try\n-   I give up or give in too easily to old ways\n\nSo if that is the case, is it really fair that I share my insights, opinions,\nbeliefs and perspectives if I don't **_fully practice what I preach_**?\n\n## The saying\n\nFirstly, that saying bothers me. I don't like it: _practice what you preach_.\nI don't feel like I am really preaching. Rather, I share. I share what I believe\nin a particular point in time. So maybe, _practice what you believe_?\n\nMy beliefs are also variable. They change, evolve and adapt over time as I learn\nnew ways and discover things that are new to me. So maybe,\n_practice your present beliefs_?\n\nWhat happens if I know something? It's good advice. I trust it but I am not yet\nready to apply it to my own life. It's knowledge but not something I yet believe.\nHow about _practice the knowledge you trust in today_?\n\n## Pursue\n\nWhatever you decide to call it, talking to someone experiencing similar\nchallenges positively impacts me and may you:\n\n-   I don't feel so alone in the circumstances or situation anymore\n-   I can relate and empathize with the person\n-   The more I talk about possibilities, the more it reinforces personally over time\n-   I get exposed to alternate options, thought patterns, perspectives and possibilities\n-   I get inspired, motivated and can learn to apply it\n-   I have a sense of worth in helping someone else\n\n## Winging it\n\nWe're all living this thing called life. It doesn't come with a handbook instead\nit has tons of philosophies, religions, spiritual beliefs, inspirational and\nself-help books, motivational quotes, perspectives, you name it. It all comes\nfrom people over decades of trying to figure this shit out.\n\nI feel like we are winging it. Some people are further along in their journey\nthan others. Some fall back decades because of some traumatic event or whatever\nthe case. Some leap beyond because something just clicked.\n\nI think the best we can do is just talk about what we learn to others. Share.\n\n## Unwelcomed\n\nSometimes we speak with such conviction. Someone has a crisis and we climb straight into\nour skin tight super-hero outfit with cape, external undies and mask to save\nthe catastrophic day by offering our solution-mode super-power capabilities.\n\nThe worst thing we can do is to **instill information** on _deaf_ ears who just **want\nto be heard or vent**. _WOAH!_ a bit on trying to save their world for a moment.\nBefore going into solution-mode it is probably best to ask:\n\n> **Are you seeking advice for your situation or do you just want to be heard?**\n\nYou should know. Sometimes you just want to shout, vent, rant, anything to get\nwhatever is bothering you off your chest. If the person starts offering all\nsorts of advice it could just aggravate the situation... right? Well it doesn't\nharm anyone in asking that question as far as I can see.\n\n## Manipulate and intimidate\n\nHas anyone ever given you advice in which you turned down and the reaction was\nthat they try to manipulate or intimidate you into taking their advice?\n\n\"If you don't do _xyz_ then I can't give you _abc_ because that is not\nacceptable. You are only going to end up in Hell.\"\n\nThere are scenarios where this form of behavior could be acceptable but\nI can't think any. I also don't advocate it although I do fall victim to\ndoing this myself to get my way. I am actively trying to stop this behavior.\n\nFor the purposes of sharing life-coaching information, insights and advice, it\nis most advisable to avoid getting frustrated when someone doesn't take it.\n\nPeople should choose to listen and believe what they want and in no way should\nyou ever take this personally. Your advice is most likely great; you just need\nto remember that everyone is on a different path / journey and therefore have\ndifferent perspectives. Your advice may or may not work for them but who cares?\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nYour life is the most important of all.\n\nDon't feel bad when people don't take your advice. Don't feel compelled to\ngive advice and don't force advice on others.\n\nIf you can get yourself to believe and trust the knowledge you share so that\nyou can fully integrate and implement it into your own life then you have done\ngood.\n\nTry to practice the knowledge you trust in today. And share it.\n",

Whether it be a new skill, new way of\ndoing something, discovering something you haven't encountered before, exploring\na new area or meeting new people and learning about their lives and behaviors.\nThis started from birth and will follow you through your adult years.\n\nThe plasticity of your brain is stronger as a child but remains plastic in your\nadult years. Your brain is not static or rigid thus keeps changing as it absorbs\nmore information.\n\nWhen you think, a chemical reaction occurs in your brain. The more you think, feel\nand act in the same way, the more it will stick.\n\nSo as your days increment, you add on to old behaviors, thought patterns, feelings\nand beliefs. You can cling to them subconsciously making you unaware of your\nbehavior as it is a reflex - an automatic response.\n\nOur brains become fragmented and filled with spam and malware which we need to\ndefragment and clean up to keep our precious hardware safe. How about the idea\nof rewiring the way our brain works to change our behaviors so that we can\nlive healthier lives.\n\nI use the term healthier in the sense that we are able to get out of depression\neasier and cope better with anger, stress and anxiety. We **let go of unhealthy\nbehaviors**. The idea is to make us healthier so that we can be more productive,\napproachable and calmer.\n\nI don't think it's healthy being overly positive or overly negative. We need\nto balance the spectrum - yin and yang - synergy. That is why I prefer the term\nhealthier over positive.\n\nIf you have ever tried to break a habit like smoking, drinking, biting your nails,\nwhatever your flavor; you will know how hard it is. The idea behind this series\nof articles called **Rewire Your Brain** is to document and share some of the\ntechniques and models available to help you successfully (hopefully) break\nbad habits and behaviors.\n\nI want to get out of the victim role where there is blame and disadvantage and\ninto the creator role where I use my circumstances to my advantage to control\nmy present destiny.\n\nI will be exploring concepts like **activating neuro pathways**, **the Satir Change\nModel**, **Neuroplasticity** and more. A lot of concepts overlap which deepens\nthe ideas behind these techniques and models.\n\nI have a deep personal interest in this topic as I desperately want to rewire\nmy brain for a healthier approach to life. I do hope you benefit from this too.\n\n* * *\n\n## References\n\n-   [After watching this, your brain will not be the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNHBMFCzznE),\n    Lara Boyd at TEDxVancouver\n-   [5 Ways To Rewire Your Brain For Meaningful Life Changes](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-11762/5-ways-to-rewire-your-brain-for-meaningful-life-changes.html),\n    MindBodyGreen, Dr. Hilary Stokes\n",

In my opinion I want to be able to get out of depression\neasier and cope better with anger, stress and anxiety. I want to **let go of unhealthy\nbehaviors**. The idea is to make me healthier so that I can be more productive,\napproachable and calmer.\n\nI want to get out of the victim role where there is blame and disadvantage and\ninto the creator role where I use my circumstances to my advantage to control\nmy present destiny.\n\nI was captivated by an article titled\n\"[5 Ways to Rewire Your Brain for Meaningful Life Changes](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-11762/5-ways-to-rewire-your-brain-for-meaningful-life-changes.html)\".\nIt's about activating neuro pathways to create new neural networks in the brain.\n\nMy article is a summary of the original for documentation purposes and adaptation\nof my understanding of the content as best I can.\n\n* * *\n\n## Activate pathways\n\nDr. Hilary Stokes wrote that Neuroscientists have discovered the strategy for\nrewiring the brain. According to her post **five neuro pathways must be activated**\nin order to create new neural networks in the brain.\n\n### 1. Identify the beliefs that support your intention\n\nYou need to believe that it is actually possible to change your behavior\nin a certain way. If you don't believe it is possible, you cannot change.\n\n-   What are your beliefs regarding the particular behavior?\n-   Identify the beliefs that make it possible to change your behavior.\n-   Make these beliefs your intention.\n\nExample: When someone is questioning Jane, she gets defensive because she\nfeels interrogated and makes her feel threatened. Those are her beliefs.\n\nShe could identify that not all questions are interrogations and that she\ndoesn't have to feel threatened.\n\nShe can use this to her advantage and as her intention to not get defensive\nthe next time she is questioned but she must believe it.\n\n### 2. Embrace your strong ~~positives~~ emotions\n\nNeutral emotions don't have enough power to induce change. If you are feeling\na strong enough emotion, use it as fuel to change your behavior.\n\n-   What emotions do you feel that drive the need to change your behavior?\n-   Why is this meaningful to you?\n-   Spend time with the emotion while you focus on your intention.\n\nExample: Jane feels embarrassed by her defensive reaction. She gets angry,\nlashes out which only results in negative responses back at her.\n\nIt's meaningful to her to change her behavior because she wants to be more\napproachable, calm and relaxed in a conversation.\n\nShe can reflect on this meaning with her emotions so that she can reinforce\nher intention.\n\n### 3. Visualize\n\nYour brain is awesome but filled with trickery. Imagination can become reality.\nYou can use this to your advantage to train your brain into new habits by\nmentally rehearsing them. This strengthens the ability to form new habits.\n\n-   What imagery aligns with changing your behavior?\n-   Visualize them daily\n\nExample: Jane could imagine being questioned by a colleague. She could imagine\ndifferent types of questioning styles specifically the ones that make her\ndefensive.\n\nShe could visualize scenes where she responds to these questions in a more\napproachable manner.\n\n### 4. Take actions that support your intention\n\nYour behavior must align with your vocabulary. You need to fully believe\nyour actions. You need to identify what actions are aligned with your\nthoughts and emotions.\n\nExample: Jane cannot say that she will be approachable but when asked questions\nbecome defensive. Her behavior must mimic her intention through practice.\n\nIf she gets it wrong, she can reflect and introspect to determine what she\nneeds to do to get it right.\n\n### 5. Repeat, repeat, repeat\n\nYou need to practice your new habit daily or you will fall back to your old\nways.\n\n-   Do this consciously (mindfully) and daily\n-   Practice thinking, feeling, visualizing and acting in alignment\n\nExample: Jane needs to be fully present in the moment of the conversation.\nShe needs to be aware of her body language, posture, vocabulary and tone.\nHer responses need to be as calm as possible and she must be aware of the\ntriggers that induce her rage.\n\nThrough activating the different pathways and by practicing her intent\nshe could succeed at breaking away from this behavior she chooses to change.\n\n* * *\n\nDr. Hilary Stokes continues to say that the key is to activate as many of these\npathways as possible given they work synergistically.\n\nOne pathway is not enough to rewire your brain. You need to repeatedly align\nyour beliefs, feelings, vision, and actions to experience lasting changes in your brain.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nDr. Hilary Stokes' article is powerful and elaborate. I encourage you to read it.\n\nUsing the techniques could be beneficial although I have not yet tried them consciously\nmyself. I see the five steps in the form of questions that I can use to explore\nand activate my own pathways.\n\n1.  What do I believe about my current behavior?\n2.  How do I leverage strong associated emotions to make a change?\n3.  What can I visualize to integrate this change into my life?\n4.  What must I actually do to integrate this change?\n5.  How can I fully believe in this change and repeatedly practice it?\n\n* * *\n\n## References\n\n-   [5 Ways To Rewire Your Brain For Meaningful Life Changes](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-11762/5-ways-to-rewire-your-brain-for-meaningful-life-changes.html),\n    MindBodyGreen, Dr. Hilary Stokes\n",

Relax. Cope.**\" We identify negative coping mechanisms and avoid self-destructive\nbehaviors so that you break the negative reinforcing loop.\n\nThrough Radical Acceptance, Distraction Plans and Relaxation Plans we are one\nstep closer to properly coping.\n\n* * *\n\nParents aren't handed instruction manuals. They just have to try. They need to\ndo the best they can, the way they know how, and with all the help they can get.\n\n> Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere where individual\n> differences are appreciated, mistakes are tolerated, communication is open\n> and rules are flexible - the kind of atmosphere that is found in a nurturing\n> family. ~ Virginia Satir\n\nI believe there will always be some form of dysfunction in a child's\nupbringing no matter how hard a parent tries to save their child from emotional harm. There will be arguments, disagreements, fights. Not only\nparents impact a child. School peers and friends, bullying and other outside\ninfluences all play a role.\n\n> Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent\n> gives the child some message about self-worth. It is sad that so many\n> parents don't realize what messages they are sending. ~ Virginia Satir\n\nWhile growing up we form our own identity with thoughts and feelings that\nmalleably take shape and change as we age. I believe that subconsciously they\nbecome concrete and automatically interact with us daily.\n\n## Childhood survival rules\n\nAs we grow up, we learn to do things that help us survive like double checking\nthe road for cars before crossing. At one stage we need to hold the hand of\nan adult. Later we grow to realize that we can cross on our own.\n\nAs adults, we may discover behaviors, thoughts, beliefs and relationships\nthat are detrimental to our well-being. Perhaps it was through a realization,\nan introspection or a significant event causing immense emotional pain.\n\nMaybe we believe these are vital to our survival until we start questioning\nif these beliefs are actually still valid.\n\nWe may need to make changes which can be hard for us because change doesn't\nalways come easy. We may resist and want to go back to a place of familiarity\nwhere we are comfortable even if there is pain involved.\n\n## Assessment\n\nRecently I noticed that when I am eating, I need to finish everything on my\nplate, even if I am full. I started interrogating this belief and realized\nthat it stems from childhood where my parents told me how other people are\nstarving in this world so I must finish my food.\n\nThis was causing me to overeat especially if I did not dish up for myself.\nI decided to change the rule. If I didn't dish up myself, I will not\nforce myself to finish the plate of food.\n\nSo watch out for these, often subtle, childhood survival rules, and decide\nif it still applies to you in you current day. Maybe it's something small or\nmaybe the behavior is actually self-destructive or causing self-harm.\n\nThese behaviors will be controlled by the automatic part of your brain so\nyou may not be consciously aware of it. When you are, you can start to\nactively work on it by rewiring you brain into a new habit or replacement\nbehavior to break the feedback loop.\n\n## Change\n\n### 1. Identify it\n\nWhen you do something try question it and see if it is still a relevant\nbehavior you need to continue.\n\n_Perhaps you work really long hours at work and you are not getting enough\nrest. You could be burning out._\n\n### 2. Analyze it\n\nConsider why you are doing it. Where does this behavior come from? Is it\nharming you in some way?\n\n_As software developers we do need to work extra hours. When you do\nit out of your own free will, what are you trying to achieve?_\n\n_Perhaps you grew up believing that the harder you work the more\nsuccessful you become._\n\n### 3. Is it a harmful response?\n\nScrutinize the dangers of the behavior. Does it negatively affect you\nor people around you?\n\n_Downtime is essential to productivity and you are missing out on it.\nIs it really constructive to continue working to your own detriment?_\n\n### 4. Does it benefit you today?\n\nPerhaps there was a time that this was working really well for you and\nyou could see the benefits even if it was harmful to you.\n\n_Let's say you were studying and put in as many hours as you could to\ncome out top of your class. This was beneficial to you but you were\nprobably left feeling exhausted._\n\n_In your current space, working longer hours probably doesn't benefit you\nmuch now because you are tired for work, your social life takes strain\nand it can impact your close personal relationships not to mention your\nown productivity, physical and psychological well-being._\n\n### 5. How can you change it, if you need to?\n\nIf you are serious about improving your well-being and see a need to\nchange this behavior, think of ways that you could change it. They can\nbe subtle changes over time to improve yourself. Drastic changes may\ncause anxiety and make you relapse to old ways.\n\n_Perhaps you could start working an hour less a day for a\nweek or so and reduce it further until you get to the standard working\nhours._\n\n_With extra time on your hands you need to find something that you enjoy\ndoing in your spare time so that you don't get frustrated. You also need\nto learn how to relax in your spare time and really rejuvenate yourself._\n\n> Problems are not the problem; coping is the problem. ~ Virginia Satir\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nWe learn things to survive over time which won't always apply to our current\nday. Back in the day we needed to learn how to flee from scary beasts and\nfend for ourselves by hunting for food and keeping warm.\n\nNowadays we need to survive in a digital age where we are all connected and\nneed to learn how we can survive in a world of business which can be just as\ncutthroat as the wilderness.\n\nIdentifying childhood survival rules, analyzing them and deciding if they are\nbeneficial today and changing them is an interesting way of rewiring your\nbrain to change behaviors of things that simply no longer apply.\n",

Changes can be short-term \n(chemical), medium term (structural) and long term (functional) and the effects \ncan be introduced in many ways to make these changes.\n\nI specifically focused on Debbie Hampton's research and knowledge on this topic\nas it is exceptionally broad and offers a variety of techniques to rewire \none's brain.\n\n* * *\n\nOur actions create reinforcing loops through our behavior. In this post I want\nto focus on unhealthy loops and what habits we can implement in order to\nimprove our quality of life and help break these loops.\n\n## Prioritize sleep\n\nThis is probably the most important habit as it impacts our health and well-being.\nAccording to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (in Feb 2012),\nongoing sleep deficiency is linked to an increased risk\nof heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke.\n\nLet's take a simple example. I have a fear of missing out or what people\nthese days call FOMO. So I tend to fight sleep. Obviously I wake up feeling\nexhausted the next day and don't get to enjoy it to its fullest because I'm tired.\n\n<span class=\"figure\">![Cycle][bad-sleep]</span>\n<span class=\"figure-caption\">Reinforcing loop for bad sleep patterns</span>\n\nSleep should be a priority. It affects physical health and daytime performance\nand safety. It's suggested that adults get at least 7 to 8 hours sleep a day\nwith a proper sleep-wake rhythm, so in other words a proper sleep routine\nthat is consistent. This will make you feel more refreshed and allow you\nto enjoy your day better.\n\n_I use a really cool Android app called Sleep as Android to monitor my sleeping\npatterns and play a lullaby (thunderstorms) to help me fall asleep._\n\n## Make good life choices\n\nAnother example can be the struggle to make good decisions. You're indecisive so\nyou go back and forth trying to make a decision. The decision you make, you\noverthink thus ending up overwhelmed and then following the herd instead of\ngoing on what you think is right.\n\nIt's important to be objective and look at the facts - consider all angles but \nmake a choice.\n\n<span class=\"figure\">![Cycle][bad-decision-making]</span>\n<span class=\"figure-caption\">Reinforcing loop for bad decision making</span>\n\n-   Formulate your own opinions and decisions\n-   Don't mistake opinions as facts\n\n## Exercise regularly\n\nApart from improving quality of life, physical activity has immediate and long-term\nhealth benefits like reducing the risk of developing several diseases.\n\n<span class=\"figure\">![Cycle][no-exercise]</span>\n<span class=\"figure-caption\">Reinforcing loop for no exercise</span>\n\n_Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.\nSee everyday activities as a good opportunity to be active.\nTry to find the time for some regular, vigorous exercise for extra health and fitness benefits.\nMinimise the amount of time spent in prolonged sitting and break up long periods of sitting as often as possible._\n\n## Other habits\n\nOver and above negative reinforcing loops it's important to\n\n-   Drink water\n-   Set up a routine\n-   Self reflect\n-   Journal\n-   Be mindful - don't focus on the past problems or future worries\n-   Meditate\n-   Practice gratitude\n-   Read\n-   Listen when people are talking\n-   Practice self control\n-   Try to achieve your goals even when you hit a roadblock\n-   Value solitude\n-   Learn to say \"no\"\n-   Create a balance in your life\n\n* * *\n\n## References\n\n-   [Why Is Sleep Important?](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/why),\n     NHLBI, NIH (National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute).\n     Last updated February 22, 2012.\n\n-   [Strategies for Getting Enough Sleep](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/strategies),\n     NHLBI, NIH (National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute).\n     Last updated February 22, 2012.\n\n-   [Sleep as Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep),\n     Google Play Store.

What a journey.\n\nI originally started this series to help me overcome some pressing personal \nissues.\n\nA lot of what I have written and researched has given me hope. What I can \nsay is that it is tremendously _&lt;insert profanity here&gt;_ difficult to practice \nthis. \n\nWith time and practice I believe that it can be very helpful in creating a \nhealthier brain overall.\n\nA summary of the series includes:\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe looked at why we need to explore the idea of rewiring the brain. In my \nopinion I want to be able to get out of depression easier and cope better \nwith anger, stress and anxiety. I want to let go of unhealthy behaviors. \nThe idea is to make me healthier so that I can be more productive, \napproachable and calmer.\n\nI want to get out of the victim role where there is blame and disadvantage \nand into the creator role where I use my circumstances to my advantage to \ncontrol my present destiny.\n\nI was captivated by an article titled “5 Ways to Rewire Your Brain for \nMeaningful Life Changes”. It’s about activating neuro pathways to create \nnew neural networks in the brain.\n\nMy article is a summary of the original for documentation purposes and \nadaptation of my understanding of the content as best I can.\n\n[Read more](/blog/rewire-your-brain-1)\n\n## Activate Neuro Pathways\n\nWe looked at how we can activate five neuro pathways in order to create new \nneural networks in the brain. This technique helps us rewire the brain to \nchange our behavior.\n\n[Read more](/blog/rewire-your-brain-2)\n\n## Distress Tolerance\n\nWe learned how to **“Distract. Relax. Cope.”** We identify negative coping \nmechanisms and avoid self-destructive behaviors so that you break the \nnegative reinforcing loop.\n\nThrough Radical Acceptance, Distraction Plans and Relaxation Plans we are \none step closer to properly coping.\n\n[Read more](/blog/rewire-your-brain-3)\n\n## Childhood Survival Rules\n\nWe look at how we can identify childhood survival rules, analyze them and \ndecide if they are beneficial today. Changing them is an interesting way of \nrewiring your brain as we change old behaviors as these rules no longer \napply to the current day.\n\n[Read more](/blog/rewire-your-brain-4)\n\n## The Satir Change Process Model\n\nWe looked at how the model can help transform unhealthy behaviors to more \npositive behaviors by working through the different stages of how we cope \nwith change.\n\nThese stages show how a change can impact us and how we can get to a \npoint where we can thrive.\n\n[Read more](/blog/rewire-your-brain-5)\n\n## Neuroplasticity\n\nWe looked at how the chemicals of the brain can change.

Stress that is self-made \nand becomes unbearable because we make it so.\n\nLet’s say you need to take your car for a service but you are running late because there \nis a queue. Your anxiety starts shooting up because you are running late for work. The attendant \nslowly checks the car for scratches and your patience is thinning. You become snappy and \nhave to wait for a way back to the office. After getting stuck in five minutes traffic \nyou are fuming and want to loose your shit. Maybe you do. Maybe you don’t.\n\nThe thing is, you could have avoided the stress and anxiety in many ways. Contact your boss \nor manager to let them know the situation. You can make alternate arrangements for time off work. \nThat one event can set the tone of the rest of your day.\n\nI have gathered some techniques which I try incorporate in my personal and work life to defuse \nand better handle stressful emotions.\n\n### Question the unknown\n\nWhen dealing with unknown situations I ask myself three simple questions:\n\nWhat do I think is the worst possible realistic outcome of the situation?\nHow will I feel about it?\nWhat will I do about it?\nPresent in the moment\n\nI practice mindfulness by focusing on the present so that my intentions are deliberate and I \nam not thinly spread. I am more focused, productive and have more time.\n\n### Aware of triggers\n\nBeing aware of my reactions empowers me to discover triggers which I can use to break the negative \nreinforcing loop. This improves the behavior over time giving me more control over it.\n\n### Distract\n\nWhen things are going south fast, a distraction can always help clear my thoughts. I can politely \nwalk away from a conversation or step out of a meeting: breathe, take a walk, read an article, listen \nto music, wash my face or grab a cup of coffee. I can re-enter the scenario once I have cooled down. \nStaying is just going to cause more harm than good.\n\nAs software developers we have a lot of things that can stress us out from working with different \ntypes of people, dealing with conflict (people and merges) and the need to constantly manage expectations \nto technical related stresses like choosing the right technology, supporting unfamiliar projects and \nfighting fires in production.\n\nWhen we become stressed and our survival-mode kicks in, our judgements are often flawed and unnecessary \nmistakes are made. The same can apply for constant worrying as our thoughts take us on a journey of many \npaths constantly ripping us away from the present.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nStress doesn’t have to consume you. There are simple techniques that we can \napply to our daily lives to minimize the impact that it can have on us.\n\nMany stressful situations can be defused by taking a breath and objectively thinking about the \nsituation without judgment on yourself or those around you.\n\nBy being more present in our day, we can be deliberate with our intentions which can make you more \nproductive and aware of the beautiful things around you.\n\nBy being mindful in my day, I am more at peace. I am more relaxed. I am more awake. I have more time. \nI am more productive. I am more free. And this makes me happy.\n\n## References\n\n-   [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), a meditation app\n-   [Five steps to mindfulness](https://www.mindful.org/five-steps-to-mindfulness/) by Thich Nhat Hanh\n-   [12 Techniques to stop worrying](http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/stop-worrying/) by Cindy Holbrook\n-   [Meditation isn’t about suppressing your thoughts and emotions](https://medium.com/meditation-without-mysticism/meditation-isn-t-about-suppressing-your-thoughts-and-emotions-4de935d61213) by J.

If commits are monolithic\n> and the messages suck... what exactly are you going back to?\n\nI use Git at work and in my personal playground. It gives me the confidence I\nneed to explore options and experiment without fear of losing changes.\n\nWith such a powerful tool comes responsibility. If commits are\nmonolithic, have useless messages and contributors are not mindful of\nhow the history evolves over time; you end up with a dirty history that\ncan't help you much when you need to go back in time.\n\nIf you work in a team or are contributing code remotely, you need to be aware\nof a few habits that could help you in the future:\n\n## Reformatting files\n\nIt's okay to reformat badly or incorrectly formatted files. It is not okay to\ncommit it along with your change. Try it out and check the diff. Can you spot your\nchange easily? Show it to someone else to see if they can spot it.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/importance-of-git-history/mixed-diff-with-formatting-and-code-changes.jpg\"\n     description=\"Example of an HTML diff mixed with formatting and content changes\"\n%}\n\nWhen you reformat a file automatically, you need to make sure that your\nreformatting settings are consistent with the rest of the source code.\nYou don't want to introduce tabs when spaces are being used nor do you want to\nchange the number of spaces from x to y. This introduces inconsistency.\n\nKeeping files in the correct format is important. Mixing formatting\nand code/content changes pollutes that commit. If you need to go back in time\nto find a specific change, it is going to be considerately harder to do so.\n\n## Be wary of what you commit\n\nVersion control remembers everything you have done. If you commit a large\nfile it stays in version control even after you delete it.\nIt will take a while for your repo to be cloned if people are\ncontributing from countries where bandwidth is slow and often limited.\n\nCorporate repositories should be no different. Often people work remotely\non support or from a different region and can also end up suffering.\n\nAlso be mindful of committing sensitive data such as passwords and SSH keys.\n\n**Tip**: There is a way to [remove data](https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/)\nusing the `BFG Repo-Cleaner`. This will permanently remove files from your\nrepository's history.\n\n## Atomic commits\n\nAvoid monolithic commits - a large set of changes that affect a lot of files.\nThis makes reverting difficult. You have to revert the entire commit thus\nlosing other changes you may want to keep.\n\nComplete a bite-size chunk of work and commit it. Do this regularly. Each\ncommit should be a piece of code that can exist independently in production.\n\nIf you need to explore options or experiment you could branch out and go crazy.\nWhen you're finished you could simply\n[rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) everything\non top of the central branch your team is developing on.\n\nIf you screw up on a collection of commits on your **local branch**, you can\nrewrite the history using an\n[interactive rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history).\nThis allows you to squash commits and alter commit messages.\n\n> **Sean Patterson** has some great insights on\n> [atomic commits](http://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/).\n\n## Don't push work in progress\n\nIf you are not finished with a piece of work you could\n[stash](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/branching-merging/stashing#start)\nyour changes. If you are concerned about losing hours of work then you need to\nstart practicing branching and atomic commits.\n\n## Verify the `diff`\n\nIf you have made changes, carefully check each line that you are committing\nin the `diff`. GUIs like [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) and\n[Git Extensions](https://gitextensions.github.io) allow you to easily stage\nor discard lines.\n\n-   IDEs can make unnecessary changes to files\n-   You may want to discard an experimental line\n-   The line no longer makes sense to introduce\n\n**Note**: When you discard changes, always build the source code before\ncompleting the commit. If you forget this and there is a compilation or runtime\nerror you can always fix it by doing a `git commit --amend` to\n[amend your last commit](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/).\n\nIf you are wary of losing important changes by discarding then\n[stash](https://git-scm.com/book/no-nb/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing) your\nchanges. Apply them and discard your lines. You could always apply\nthe stash again later. When you are done, delete your stash.\n\n## Useful messages\n\nThe importance of this cannot be stressed enough. This is what you see in\nyour `git log` and remote repository. Messages need to be informative.\n\nI am not going to make up my own rules because I agree with the ones that\nalready exist.

Git\nwon't guess which changes should be the chosen ones. You really need to be\nawake when\n[resolving a conflict](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/merge-conflicts#start)\nso that you don't accidently discard other\nchanges. If possible sit with the other person who committed the change to\nresolve it.\n\n## Be wary of automatic pushing\n\nSome developers prefer to push\n[directly after a commit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7925850/how-to-automatically-push-after-committing-in-git).\nSome GUIs even have this feature built in. This must be used with caution. Once you\nhave pushed you can't easily fix that commit by amending or rebasing. It can\nalso break your build if you have discarded lines without the chance to verify\nthe build.\n\n## Learn from your mistakes\n\nYou are bound to do something that is going to come back to bite you. When this\nhappens it is an opportunity for you to learn how to improve. Share what you\nhave learned with your team so that others don't have to make the same mistakes\nin the future.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\n> Source control is a developer’s best friend. The ability to share code\n> with multiple developers, track changes, and easily roll back when\n> problems arise is indispensable in this distributed world. ~\n> [**Sean Patterson**](http://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/)\n\nVersion control is not just there to backup code. It can get you out of a\npickle fast. You need to think about how your commits could affect you and\nyour team in the future.\n\nGuide team members who are new to version control - or to this mindset - so that\nthey understand its true importance and can start practicing better version\ncontrol etiquette.\n\n* * *\n\nWant to find out more about Git?\n\n-   [Getting Git right](https://www.atlassian.com/git/) by Atlassian\n-   [Learn Version Control with Git](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/basics/why-use-version-control)\n    a step-by-step course for the complete beginner\n",

This highlighted popular class names,\nelements, attributes and other related metadata.\n\nThe data surfaced many structural requirements related to `div`'s with\nclasses of `nav`, `header`, `footer`, `sidebar` etc.\n\nAs HTML5 is not intended to be used to markup documents for presentation, it\nrather aims to add meaning to the elements within a document in order to\nenhance:\n\n-   accessibility,\n-   search indexing,\n-   internationalization and\n-   interoperability.\n\nAlthough the `div` is still useful to enhance the layout of a document, the\nnewly added structural elements in HTML5 will aid the semantic structuring\nof your page.\n\n**Note**: There are many books, articles, wikis and posts relating to these elements.\nI wanted to document my research by combining the semantics, usage and code\nsamples to act as a cheatsheet to personally use.\n\n## Header\n\nYou can use the `header` element to group introductory content or navigational\naids.\n\nIt's intended to contain headings but can also be used to wrap a section's\ntable of contents, site navigation, a search form or any relevant logos and so on.\n\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-markup\">\n&lt;header&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Alliance vs Horde&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n    Which side are you on? The Alliance or the Horde?\n    Both sides have equally captivating\n    stories to tell.\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/header&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n[MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header)\n\n## Footer\n\nYou can use the `footer` element in a document or many sections to\ncontain:\n\n-   copyright information,\n-   contact details,\n-   author details,\n-   navigational aid like a sitemap,\n-   back to the top of the page links, or\n-   related references.\n\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-markup\">\n&lt;footer&gt;\n  The content on the World of Warcraft Wiki is\n  licensed under CC-BY-SA.\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n**Note**: It doesn’t affect the document outline as it isn’t considered\nas sectioning content.\n\n[MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer)\n\n## Nav\n\nYou can use the `nav` element in your document or many sections to contain:\n\n-   site wide navigation bar containing links to other pages or sections within\n    a page,\n-   sections that contain additional navigation aids, and\n-   footer navigation containing common terms of service, privacy policy and\n    copyright links.\n\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-markup\">\n&lt;header&gt;\n  &lt;nav&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;History&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Alliance&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Horde&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/nav&gt;\n&lt;/header&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n[MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav)\n\n## Article\n\nYou can use the `article` element for sections of content that can be\nindependently distributed or reused such as:\n\n-   forum or blog post,\n-   article for a magazine, newspaper or online website, or\n-   content submitted by a user.\n\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-markup\">\n&lt;article&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;For the Horde&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      &lt;time\n        pubdate\n        datetime=\"2016-06-18T08:30:00.00\"&gt;\n      &lt;/time&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;\n    The Horde is made up of Orcs, Forsaken, Tauren,\n    Trolls, Blood Elves, Goblins, and most recently,\n    Pandaren (Huojin).\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n[MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article)\n\n## Section\n\nYou can use the `section` element for generic sections of content that need to\nbe explicitly listed in the document outline. You can then group content based\non a theme or context such as:\n\n-   introductions,\n-   news items,\n-   contact information, and\n-   numbered sections of a thesis.\n\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-markup\">\n&lt;article&gt;\n  &lt;section&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;King of the Alliance&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      The Supreme Allied Commander of the humans, also\n      known as the king.

If\nyou want to enforce compatibility with legacy browsers you can style\nthese elements in CSS to be block-level elements.\n\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-css\">\narticle, section, aside, nav, header, footer {\n  display: block;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nUnfortunately some legacy browsers don't apply styling to unknown elements.\nIf you need to support them, you could reference the\n[HTML5 Shiv JavaScript](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv)\nfor display and printing of your documents.\n\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-markup\">\n&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"html5shiv.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;![endif]--&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nWhen I tested the document outline of my blog I realized that I have been\nusing these elements incorrectly as they provided little to no and often\nincorrect meaning to the structure of my documents. It's amazing what a bit of\nresearch can teach you.\n\nYou can test the structure of your documents using Document Outline tools.\nUnfortunately I cannot vouch for the correctness of the tools provided below.\n\n-   [Online tester](https://gsnedders.html5.org) by gsnedders\n-   HTML5 Outliner [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html5-outliner/afoibpobokebhgfnknfndkgemglggomo?hl=en)\n    by Dominykas Blyžė\n-   HTML5 Outliner [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/html5_outliner/)\n    by arky\n\nIt can be tricky to know what to use and when.\n[HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com) has a great\nflowchart to help save time when making these decisions.

If you keep grinding\nthrough tasks, your brain gets tired and can go on auto-pilot. This can impact\nyour focus, productivity, decision making and mood.\n\n> Do you really squeeze more productivity out of yourself by powering through\n> your weariness? ~ Caroline Webb\n\nFerris Jabr\n[wrote](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mental-downtime/)\n\"research on naps, meditation, nature walks and the habits of\nexceptional artists and athletes reveals how mental breaks increase\nproductivity, replenish attention, solidify memories and encourage creativity.\"\n\nWe can't always achieve these things in our daily working hours however\nthere are a some things we can do to take deliberate downtime for mental\nreplenishment.\n\n## Sabbaticals\n\nI had the opportunity to work with an amazing woman who took a year sabbatical\nto South America after finishing a string of large projects. She needed the\nbreak. This is a great way to recharge your mind and body as well as change\nyour perspective on life. Unfortunately we don't all have this luxury in our\nlifetimes.\n\nIf you are changing your job and have enough money to take some time off in\nbetween jobs then you can mentally prepare yourself for your next challenge.\nEven if it's as short as a week or two.\n\n## Vacations\n\nIf you are on a payroll, then you get offered a certain amount of leave\neach year. Make sure to take it. It's important.\n\nEarlier this month, my husband and I went to Mauritius for 7 days for a wedding.\nIt was my first island experience and I have been wanting to go there for years.\nThis was a great opportunity for me to switch off from the world and relax.\n\nIn my experience software developers are on standby almost all the time. This\nmakes taking leave and actually relaxing somewhat troublesome. I didn't want\nto feel anxious throughout my vacation so this is the advice I can give you:\n\n-   **Make your leave visible in advance**<br/>\n    We have a leave calendar on our wall so that everyone in the team can see\n    when leave has been taken to aid with planning work for the upcoming sprint.\n\n-   **Tie up lose ends before leaving**<br/>\n    Go on leave knowing that you have done your best to tie up lose ends. If you\n    have a task in progress, make sure that it is either finished or someone\n    else knows how to continue the task without you. If you don't, you will worry\n    about it the whole time you are away.\n\n-   **Create an automated Out Of Office reply**<br/>\n    As simple as it sounds, it's very easy to forget. People who email you need to\n    know that you are out of the office.\n\n    Direct them to other people they can get in touch with while you are away.\n    Mention when you are back in the office so that they are aware and can make\n    decisions around that information.\n\n-   **Cancel your meetings**<br/>\n    Make sure that you cancel your meetings before going on leave. Not everyone\n    will know that you are away.\n\n-   **Switch off all notifications**<br/>\n    I made sure my phone didn't spam me with all sorts of notifications and emails\n    while I was on my trip. My phone was on silent most of the time. I didn't\n    enable roaming.\n\n    I allowed myself a few moments on some days to check Whatsapp for any dire cases\n    but only one occurred and the team was on it.\n\n-   **Remember, the world goes on without you**<br/>\n    When something breaks and you form part of a team where you are not a key\n    person dependency, you can reward yourself with deserved downtime.\n\n-   **Relax**<br/>\n    There were all sorts of activities I could do to fill up my days. I didn't\n    want to come back tired and exhausted so I made sure to commit to only a few\n    activities and enjoy every moment of my stay—busy or not.\n    I came back happy, relaxed and calmer.\n\n## Weekend getaways\n\nSmaller getaways can be taken throughout the year that don't necessarily\nrequire any leave.\n\n-   Inspect your calendar for long weekends throughout the year.\n-   Make a note of these breaks well in advance.\n-   Try to schedule a camping trip, road trip, hiking, B&B or some other getaway\n    if your finances allow for it.\n-   If you can't afford something, try to do something you don't ordinarily do\n    just for a different experience.\n-   Try not to **feel busy**. This could overload your mind and make you feel\n    like you are not getting any rest.\n\n## Evenings\n\nWhen you get home, make some time for yourself. Spend some time with your\nfriends and family. Read a book. Do something different. Put your passion aside\nfor a bit and make some time for your life.\n\nSchedule some time throughout the week to upskilling, blogging or working on a\npassion project but don't let it consume you.\n\nAs cliché as it sounds, you really only have one life. **Find your balance**\nso that you don't burn out.\n\n## Breaks\n\nTaking breaks in your working day is more sustainable as they cost you nothing\nbut a little bit of time.\n\nIf you are stuck on a problem or have just completed a task, be sure to take a\nbreak. Even if it's just 5 to 10 minutes. Caroline Webb suggests that one\nshould take a break after every 90 minutes of work.\n\nThe break should be away from your desk and should allow your mind some time\nto replenish. What you do in your break is up to you but here are some\nsuggestions:\n\n-   **Breathe**<br/>\n    Especially if you are feeling agitated. Take a few deep breaths to calm down\n    and settle your mind.\n\n-   **Go for a walk**<br/>\n    Go outside to get some fresh air. Walking offers a form of exercise and\n    going outside offers a nice change of scenery depending on where you work.\n\n    If outside doesn't work for you (pollution / not safe / cold) then just walk\n    somewhere else in the building. Take stairs. Go for coffee. Just do something\n    else away from your desk that doesn't offer a negative side-effect.\n\n-   **Write/Draw something**<br/>\n    If you are struggling with something, go sit somewhere away from your desk.\n    Map out what you are doing on paper. Visualizing the problem could\n    illustrate possible solutions that you couldn't see before.\n\n-   **Talk to someone**<br/>\n    Walk to someone and talk to them about the problem you are working on.\n    Listen to what is said objectively. Suggestions don't need to be implemented\n    but they may contain insights that you may not have thought of before\n    in your mentally clouded state.\n\n-   **Reflect**<br/>\n    Give yourself time to reflect after completing a task. Knowing what you know\n    now, what would you do differently in the future?\n\n-   **Lunch**<br/>\n    Try not to eat lunch at your desk. Take time to eat lunch with your colleagues\n    and find yourself talking about interesting conversations.\n\nA break should not be to waste time or escape something critical but rather to\nboost your mind and productivity. Experiment until you find the thing that\nboosts yours.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nDowntime is essential. Relaxation is important. Burn out is real.\n\nIf we allow all the superficial stress that can build up in our professional\nlives to build up, then we will indeed experience it.\n\nWhether it is as simple as a break or a little long term as a\nvacation or sabbatical, find ways to keep replenishing your mind.\n\n* * *\n\n## References\n\n-   Reading [How to Have a Good Day](http://carolinewebb.co/books/how-to-have-a-good-day/) by Caroline Webb.\n    You can get it from\n    [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/How-Have-Good-Day-Behavioral/dp/0553419633),\n    [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Caroline_Webb_How_To_Have_A_Good_Day?id=Ml3ZCQAAQBAJ),\n    [iBooks](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/how-to-have-a-good-day/id999030561?mt=11),\n    [Takealot.com](http://www.takealot.com/how-to-have-a-good-day-ebook/PLID41212844),\n    anywhere else online or your favorite book store.\n-   Why Your Brain Needs Downtime by [Ferris Jabr](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mental-downtime/).\n-   We stayed at [Zilwa Attitude Resort](http://zilwa-hotel-mauritius.com/) in Mauritius.\n",

This was [caused](/rca/unicode-displaying-incorrectly/)\nby the missing byte order mark in the UTF-8 file which Windows actually requires.\n\nThis post was inspired by my curiosity and investigation of the byte order mark\nbut further grew as it touched on UTF, endianness and the usage of the byte order\nmark in UTF-8.\n\n## Unicode\n\nIf you are new to Unicode then I suggest you read up on it before continuing.\nYou can start by reading\n[Joel Spolsky's](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html) article\nfrom 2003.\n\nIn this post I make references to Unicode code points. They are simply the\nnumerical positions of Unicode characters in the code space of 1,114,112\ncharacters.\n\n> For Unicode, the particular sequence of bits is called a code unit – for\n> the UCS-4 encoding, any code point is encoded as 4-byte (octet) binary\n> numbers, while in the UTF-8 encoding, different code points are encoded as\n> sequences from one to four bytes long, forming a self-synchronizing code. ~\n> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point)\n\n## UTF\n\nUTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format. This encoding maps\nUnicode code points (from `U+0000` to `U+10FFFF`) to one or more code units or\n[word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)) depending on\nthe encoding form (eg. UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32) used.\n\nConversions between encoding forms are algorithmic making it fast and lossless.\n\nThe table below shows the different encoding forms with some of their properties.\n\n| Name                            |   UTF-8  |  UTF-16  |  UTF-32 |\n| ------------------------------- | :------: | :------: | :-----: |\n| Code unit or word size          |   8-bit  |  16-bit  |  32-bit |\n| Fewest bytes used per character |  1 byte  |  2 bytes | 4 bytes |\n| Most bytes used per character   |  4 bytes |  4 bytes | 4 bytes |\n| Byte width for a code unit      | Variable | Variable |  Fixed  |\n\nEssentially a single character represented as a sequence of\n`<fewest bytes>` to `<most bytes>` `<code unit size>`-bit code units or word,\ndepending on the encoding form:\n\n-   UTF-8 is variable as it can have a sequence of one to four 8-bit bytes per character\n-   UTF-16 is variable as it can have a sequence of one or two 16-bit code units per character\n-   UTF-32 is fixed as it has a single 32-bit code unit per character\n\nAs UTF-32 is fixed length, it can get rather bloated and use up unnecessary\nmemory and storage space for strings of characters. Therefore it's main usage\nis in internal APIs where the data is single code points or glyphs.\n\nLet's look at an example using the Pilcrow sign (¶). It's Unicode code point\nis `U+00B6`.\n\n-   In UTF-8 it converts to `C2 B6` which is a two 8-bit sequence of\n    `[1100 0010] [1011 0110]`.\n\n-   In UTF-16 it converts to `00 B6` which is a one 16-bit sequence of\n    `[0000 0000 1011 0110]`.\n\n-   In UTF-32 it converts to `00 00 00 B6` which is a one 32-bit sequence of\n    `[1011 0110 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000]`\n\n## Endianness\n\nThis is just a fancy way of saying how the **bytes must be ordered** during the\nread and the write of the stream. This order is categorized by big-endian and\nlittle-endian.\n\nBytes can be processed from left to right (big-endian: most significant byte\nfirst) or from right to left (little-endian: least significant byte first).\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/byte-order-mark/endianness.gif\"\n     description=\"Example of a 32-bit integer committed to memory differently for big-endian and little-endian\"\n%}\n\nAs the word size for UTF-8 streams is 8-bits, one byte is read or written at a\ntime. This means the encoding form is byte-oriented so there is no byte order\nproblem for UTF-8.\n\nWith UTF-16 and UTF-32 they have word sizes of 2 (16-bits) and 4 (32-bits) bytes\nrespectively making the byte order matter when it comes to certain hardware,\nprotocols or programs. The byte order is indicated with the byte order mark\nor in short, the BOM.\n\nThis table shows UTF-16 and UTF-32 with their big-endian (BE)\nand little-endian (LE) equivalents. If a stream is not saved with the BOM then\nit will default to big-endian.\n\n| Encoding | Little-Endian | Big-Endian |\n| -------- | :-----------: | :--------: |\n| UTF-16   |       -       |   Default  |\n| UTF-16LE |   \\\\&lt;BOM>  |      -     |\n| UTF-16BE |       -       | \\\\&lt;BOM> |\n| UTF-32   |       -       |   Default  |\n| UTF-32LE |   \\\\&lt;BOM>  |      -     |\n| UTF-32BE |       -       | \\\\&lt;BOM> |\n\n## Byte order mark (BOM)\n\nIt is an invisible Unicode magic number found at the beginning of a data stream\nindicating the encoding and endianness.\n\nThis table shows encoding forms with their BOM byte sequence and byte order.\n\n| Encoding | Endianness    | BOM bytes   |\n| -------- | ------------- | ----------- |\n| UTF-8    | N/A           | EF BB BF    |\n| UTF-16   | Big-endian    | FE FF       |\n| UTF-16   | Little-endian | FF FE       |\n| UTF-32   | Big-endian    | 00 00 FE FF |\n| UTF-32   | Little-endian | FF FE 00 00 |\n\nLet's say we have a text stream of the following characters: `¶@«®`. The Unicode\ncode points for each are `U+00B6`, `U+0040`, `U+00AB` and `U+00AE`.\n\n{% include posts/image-caption.html\n     url=\"/img/posts/byte-order-mark/bom.gif\"\n     description=\"The byte order mark for UTF-16 (big-endian and little-endian) and UTF-8\"\n%}\n\nWhen the UTF-16 streams are opened, the BOM defines the order the bytes must be\nread in and are read two bytes (16-bits) at a time. The way the bytes are mapped\nback to the Unicode code points are based on the endianness.\n\nWhen the UTF-8 stream is opened, the BOM has no impact on the byte order as\nthe bytes are read one at a time.\n\nLooking at the Heavy Black Heart (❤) character at code point `U+2764`:\n\n-   In UTF-8 it converts to `E2 9D A4` which is a three 8-bit sequence of\n    `[1110 0010] [1001 1101] [1010 0100]`.\n\n-   In UTF-16BE it converts to `27 64` which is a one 16-bit sequence of\n    `[0010 0111 0110 0100]`.\n\n-   In UTF-16LE it converts to `64 27` which is a one 16-bit sequence of\n    `[0110 0100 0010 0111]`.\n\n-   In UTF-32BE it converts to `00 00 27 64` which is a one 32-bit sequence of\n    `[0000 0000 0000 0000 0010 0111 0110 0100]`.\n\n-   In UTF-32LE it converts to `64 27 00 00` which is a one 32-bit sequence of\n    `[0110 0100 0010 0111 0000 0000 0000 0000]`.\n\n## UTF-8\n\nWhen the BOM exists it acts as an **encoding signature** only. In this case it\nis referred to as the UTF-8 signature.\n\nAlthough it is optional and doesn't signify the byte order, some applications\nrequire its presence. I learned the [hard way](/rca/unicode-displaying-incorrectly)\nwith Microsoft Windows and some of its applications.\n\n> Microsoft compilers and interpreters, and many pieces of software on\n> Microsoft Windows such as Notepad treat the BOM as a required magic\n> number rather than use heuristics. These tools add a BOM when saving text\n> as UTF-8, and cannot interpret UTF-8 unless the BOM is present, or the file\n> contains only ASCII bytes. ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)\n\nThere are also instances where the BOM must not exist. This can include files\nthat need to start with specific characters like the human readable shebang\nmagic number (`#!`) in Unix shell scripts.\n\nIt's also nice to know that ASCII is a subset of Unicode. It is a 7-bit encoding\nbut 1 bit goes unused and is always saved as 1 byte. This makes UTF-8 backwards\ncompatible with ASCII assuming the file doesn't use characters outside of the\nASCII range.\n\nIf the BOM exists but cannot be interpreted correctly the file will start with\n`ï»¿`. An example is viewing the BOM file with the Latin 1 (ISO 8859-1)\ncharacter encoding.\n\n## BOM guidelines\n\nIf you are working directly with a stream or are uncertain of which encoding to\nuse, [Unicode.org](http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html) has the following\nguidelines for dealing with the BOM:\n\n-   A particular protocol (e.g. Microsoft conventions for .txt files) may require\n    use of the BOM on certain Unicode data streams, such as files. When you\n    need to conform to such a protocol, use a BOM.\n\n-   Some protocols allow optional BOMs in the case of untagged text. In those cases,\n\n    -   Where a text data stream is known to be plain text, but of unknown encoding,\n        BOM can be used as a signature. If there is no BOM, the encoding could be\n        anything.\n    -   Where a text data stream is known to be plain Unicode text\n        (but not which endian), then BOM can be used as a signature. If there is no\n        BOM, the text should be interpreted as big-endian.\n\n-   Some byte oriented protocols expect ASCII characters at the beginning of a\n    file. If UTF-8 is used with these protocols, use of the BOM as encoding form\n    signature should be avoided.\n\n-   Where the precise type of the data stream is known (e.g. Unicode big-endian\n    or Unicode little-endian), the BOM should not be used. In particular,\n    whenever a data stream is declared to be UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE or\n    UTF-32LE a BOM must not be used.\n\n<small>This excerpt can be found under the question \"**How I should deal with\nBOMs?**\"</small>\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nThe BOM is usually handled in the background by the systems you are working\non. As it is invisible it generally goes unnoticed.\n\nIf you start to experience some funny visuals, you are most likely experiencing\nan encoding problem that can easily be fixed. Using a Hex Editor you can\nidentify the invisible bytes in a file.\n\n* * *\n\n## References\n\n-   [Root cause analysis](/rca/unicode-displaying-incorrectly/) inspiring this post\n-   [What is Unicode?](http://unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html) - Unicode.org\n-   [Introduction to Unicode](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html) - Joel on Software\n-   [Unicode code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point) - Wikipedia.org\n-   [Unicode character table](http://unicode-table.com/) - Unicode-table.com\n-   [Endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) - Wikipedia.org\n-   [Byte order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) - Wikipedia.org\n-   [FAQs](http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html) (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 & BOM) - Unicode.org\n-   [The byte order mark in HTML](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-byte-order-mark) - W3.org\n-   [Using byte order marks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374101(v=vs.85).aspx) - MSDN\n-   [UTF-8](http://www.utf-8.com/) - Utf-8.com\n-   [The Turkey Test](http://www.moserware.com/2008/02/does-your-code-pass-turkey-test.html) - moserware.com\n\n[Copyright](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/ipr-notice#Copyright)\n© 2016 W3C® ([MIT](http://www.csail.mit.edu/), [ERCIM](http://www.ercim.eu/),\n[Keio](http://www.keio.ac.jp/), [Beihang](http://ev.buaa.edu.cn/)).\nThis document includes material copied from or derived from\n[The byte-order mark (BOM) in HTML](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-byte-order-mark).\"\nThe [BOM](/img/posts/byte-order-mark/bom.gif)\nimage in this post adapted from their endianness image.\n",

Sadly, this is not the first time this has happened to me. My inner\nimposter was once again \"shining\" and I was left feeling inadequate.\n\n> He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes\n>  wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.\n>  ― Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nImposter syndrome <sup id=\"footnote-1\">[1](#footnote-1-ref)</sup> is getting\na lot of attention within our community probably because research\n<sup id=\"footnote-2\">[2](#footnote-2-ref)</sup> has estimated that 70% of the\ngeneral population has felt imposter tendencies in some part of their career.\n\nIt's not a disease. It is a misshapen reality concocted by self-limiting beliefs\nand feelings of inadequacy. This reality remains solid even when information\nis presented that disproves it. The mind clings to the emotion rather than\nthe fact.\n\nIn my research on this topic, a common underlying message stands out:\n**nobody really knows what they're doing all the time**. So the best anyone can\nreally do is to just try, fail, learn from it and try again.\n\nLogically I know this. Yet here I sit in my trough period trying to get out once\nagain. So **instead of being hard on myself I am just accepting that right now\nit may seem bad, but this too shall pass**.\n\nTo help me progress, I can try to understand the compounding feelings that\ncontribute to this state of mind. By dissecting each one I may be able to make\nsmall adjustments to help me progress out of this:\n\n## Self-doubt\n\n> I'd far rather be happy than right any day.\n> ― Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nI've been a software developer for a long time now. In my mind, I don't live up\nto my own expectations (which I have learned are exceptionally high for some\nreason). There is still so much I don't know, so much that I am uncertain of.\n\nHow can you persuade someone to understand something if you have little\nconfidence in your own understanding? Doubt destroys confidence. Self-doubt\ndestroys confidence in yourself.\n\nLogically I know it's impossible to be certain of everything yet doubt\nlooms over me like a towering monster in the dark. I know that we simply have\nto figure things out as we go,\nremembering that it's okay to be wrong provided we learn from it. Some days\nare just better than others for me.\n\nThere are many techniques <sup id=\"footnote-3\">[3](#footnote-3-ref)</sup> to aid\nthose suffering with self-doubt such as:\n\n-   Remember past successes and know that you had a role contributing to it.\n-   Talk to your peers about it. Chances are they are feeling the same.\n-   Keep a journal. Write down the good and bad and try to find a pattern.\n-   Don't beat yourself up.\n-   Don't compare yourself to others. It's unfair on yourself as you may have\n    different focus areas.\n-   Land an interview even if you're happy with your job. It can be a great\n    reminder that you're skilled and valuable.\n-   Everyone struggles of something. Accept this, then punch fear in the face.\n\n## Uncertainty\n\n> That's what I mean about A-Z plans, you see. I had no idea that things were\n> going to turn out like this, so there was no way I could have planned things\n> out. You just have to cope with what's happening, and deal with the next bit\n> when it comes. ― Michael Marshall Smith, Only Forward\n\nUncertainty (depending on the context) can sometimes make me very anxious.\nAt work, I don't like hearing myself say \"I don't know\".\n\nYet this happens regularly. I don't know how long something is going to take to\nwork on, the impact it may have on the system or on the user, the complexity\nthat may creep in, the right people to talk to. I don't know because I don't\nhave all the facts. What I can do is figure it out as I go.\n\nThe beauty of our industry (and life in general) is that there is still so much\nwe don't really know. No one knows everything no matter how fanatic people can\nbe in certain areas.\n\nThere is no right way of doing something. There is always a better way. So we\nfigure things out. We put different pieces of the puzzle together. We\ntroubleshoot and fix things that are broken. We learn. We create.\n\nSome techniques <sup id=\"footnote-4\">[4](#footnote-4-ref)</sup> we\ncan use in the face of uncertainty include:\n\n-   Know that certainty is an illusion. Things can change in a heartbeat.\n-   Focus on what you can control.\n-   Get confident about your coping and adapting skills.\n-   Prepare for different possibilities.\n-   Accept constant imperfection.\n-   Don't get attached to everything. When it changes you tend to suffer.\n-   Reconnect with the constants in your life.\n-   Practice mindfulness.\n-   Ask yourself these three questions:\n    -   What do I think is the worst possible realistic outcome of the situation?\n    -   How will I feel about it?\n    -   What will I do about it?\n\n> We are water. We evaporate, we freeze, we fall, we cool, we crash in waves,\n> we ebb and flow, we soothe, swim and foam. A part of us looks the same to a\n> mind that wants to condense and categorize, but in the end, we are\n> constantly recreated anew. ― Disqus user drb74\n\n## Comparing yourself to others\n\n> The reason why we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind\n> the scenes with everyone else's highlight reel. ― Steven Furtick\n\nWe can't see the full picture of everyone around us. We don't know the troubles\nthey face, what makes them really tick, what fears and weaknesses they\nbattle out each day and what circumstantial history they have.\n\nInstead get better at knowing yourself. You have the full picture of someone\ntruly amazing right in front of you, no matter how flawed you think you are.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\n> Would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?\n> ― Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nI started this post on Monday but I couldn't finish it. It's been a real struggle\ntrying to write about something that I keep telling myself no one will really\ncare about. This time I got hit hard by imposter syndrome.\n\nThere is a lot of talk about it in the community to raise awareness for this\nstruggle that plagues most of us. It's just a state of mind that can be\ncontrolled.\n\nWhen I started this post, I reached out on Twitter for some peer guidance and\nthe responses made me feel good.\n\nLet's give them a shout out based on my question \"Anyone suffering from\nimposter syndrome lately? I'm writing a post. If you have any advice you wish\nto share let me know.\"\n\n-   Far too often. I’m getting better at overcoming it, though.

This makes it\nhard for me to find out why I react the way I do in certain situations.\n\nIn some cases I am proud of how I act but other cases I feel bad and wish I\ndidn't say or do something in that moment.\n\nIf I can't consciously identify the trigger, I have less control of my behavior\nwhich is often driven by an automated response.\n\n## Introspection\n\nIntrospection is a good way to become aware of your behavior. This is where\nyou take time to think about your mental and emotional processes. It can help\nyou identify triggers that cause you to act the way you do. You can become\nself-aware and consciously change your behavior with time, patience and practice.\n\nAlthough I believe it is a good daily practice to incorporate in ones life,\nit can take a lot of time to figure out who you are and what drives your behavior.\n\n## Journaling\n\nAnother technique is to capture specific moments, reactions and feelings in a\njournal each day. It can improve your introspection over a longer period of time.\n\nI struggle to keep a journal but do see the value in doing so as it documents\nyour personality whereby you could draw interesting conclusions to what triggers\nyour behavior over time especially when you have difficulty remembering things.\n\n-   [How to Journal for Therapy](http://www.wikihow.com/Journal-for-Therapy) from\n    wikiHow\n-   [10 Journaling Tips to Help You Heal, Grow and Thrive](http://tinybuddha.com/blog/10-journaling-tips-to-help-you-heal-grow-and-thrive/)\n    from the Tiny Buddha\n-   [The Power in Writing About Yourself](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/ew-feelings/383475/)\n    from The Atlantic\n\n## Personality tests\n\nI generally don't buy into personality tests and quizzes but I was recently\nexposed to two tests that yielded eerie results - capturing my core\npersonality traits in words that I strongly relate to.\n\n-   [Enneagram](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/)\n-   [16Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/)\n\nHaving taken the tests I have been exposed to a better understanding of\nmyself - a stepping stone to self awareness - which would have taken much\nlonger to achieve through introspection and journaling.\n\nThe combination of reports provide information relating to:\n\n-   What makes you tick\n-   Your strengths and weaknesses\n-   Why and how you behave in different relationships and situations\n-   Your behavior in teams, leadership and management\n-   Your career paths and workplace habits\n-   Your growth paths\n-   Your blind spots\n-   How you deal with conflict\n-   How you make decisions\n-   How to attain Mastery in your profession\n\n## Enneagram\n\nAccording to Integrative, a South African-based company that provides Enneagram\nSolutions, the Enneagram is an archetypal framework that offers in-depth\ninsight to individuals, groups and collectives.\n\nIt consists of\n[three centres of intelligence](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/centres/),\n[nine main Enneagram types](https://www.integrative.co.za/Enneagram/Introduction/),\n[18 wings](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/wings-lines-integration/), and\n[three subtypes and Triadic styles](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/27-subtypes/).\n\nThey go on to say that it does not box in people, but rather opens a pathway\nto self-discovery and greater personal awareness.\n\n> The Integrative Enneagram Questionnaire draws on the collective body of\n> knowledge and experience from many pioneers in the Enneagram field and as the\n> developers of the iEQ9 we would like to acknowledge the experts,\n> philosophers and practitioners for their contribution to the development\n> and application of the model as we understand it today. ~ Dirk Cloete,\n> Founder Integrative9 Enneagram Solutions\n\nThere are places where you can take the test for free however the Integrative\ntest is paid for. They offer\n[three reports](https://www.integrative.co.za/GetYourType/) at different costs\ndepending on how much information you want to gain from the test.\n\nThe nine Enneagram types include:\n\n1.  **[Strict Perfectionist](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/introduction/type-1/)**:\n    The Rational, Idealistic Type: Principled, Purposeful, Self-Controlled, and Perfectionistic\n\n2.  **[Considerate Helper](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/introduction/type-2/)**:\n    The Caring, Interpersonal Type: Demonstrative, Generous, People-Pleasing, and Possessive\n\n3.  **[Competitive Achiever](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/introduction/type-3/)**:\n    The Success-Oriented, Pragmatic Type: Adaptive, Excelling, Driven, and Image-Conscious\n\n4.  **[Intense Creative](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/introduction/type-4/)**:\n    The Sensitive, Withdrawn Type: Expressive, Dramatic, Self-Absorbed, and Temperamental\n\n5.  **[Quiet Specialist](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/introduction/type-5/)**:\n    The Intense, Cerebral Type: Perceptive, Innovative, Secretive, and Isolated\n\n6.  **[Loyal Sceptic](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/introduction/type-6/)**:\n    The Committed, Security-Oriented Type: Engaging, Responsible, Anxious, and Suspicious\n\n7.  **[Enthusiastic Visionary](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/introduction/type-7/)**:\n    The Busy, Fun-Loving Type: Spontaneous, Versatile, Distractible, and Scattered\n\n8.  **[Active Controller](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/introduction/type-8/)**:\n    The Powerful, Dominating Type: Self-Confident, Decisive, Willful, and Confrontational\n\n9.  **[Adaptive Peacemaker](https://www.integrative.co.za/enneagram/introduction/type-9/)**:\n    The Easygoing, Self-Effacing Type: Receptive, Reassuring, Agreeable, and Complacent\n\n_They are labelled differently depending on the institute\nbut revolve around the same principles. The above are labelled by Integrative\nwhile the descriptions come from\n[enneagraminstitute.com](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions)._\n\n## 16Personalities\n\nThis test is free but has premium content that you can pay for if you so choose.\nThe free content is extensive, very informative and eerily accurate.\n\nIn fact, at the time of writing they actually mention that you get a\n'freakishly accurate' description of who you are and why you do things the way\nyou do.\n\nAs the name suggests there are [16 personality types](https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types)\neach with its own [acronym](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/our-theory)\nbroken down into 4 categories:\n\n_Note for the acronyms:_\n\n_These are the five personality aspects. They define the personality type when\nthey are combined._\n\n-   **_Mind_** - _Introversion (I) or Extraversion (E)_\n-   **_Energy_** - _Intuition (N) or Sensing (S)_\n-   **_Nature_** - _Thinking (T) or Feeling (F)_\n-   **_Tactics_** - _Judging (J) or Perceiving (P)_\n-   **_Identity_** - _Assertive (-A) or Turbulent (-T)_\n\n_The Identity aspect underpins all personalities, showing how confident we are\nin our abilities and decisions. They elaborate on this in\n[their theory](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/our-theory)._\n\n### Analysts\n\n-   **[Architect](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality)**: (INTJ Personality)\n    Imaginative and strategic thinkers, with a plan for everything.\n\n-   **[Logician](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)**: (INTP Personality)\n    Innovative inventors with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.\n\n-   **[Commander](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality)**: (ENTJ Personality)\n    Bold, imaginative and strong-willed leaders, always finding a way – or making one.\n\n-   **[Debater](https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality)**: (ENTP Personality)\n    Smart and curious thinkers who cannot resist an intellectual challenge.\n\n### Diplomats\n\n-   **[Advocate](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality)**: (INFJ Personality)\n    Quiet and mystical, yet very inspiring and tireless idealists.\n\n-   **[Mediator](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality)**: (INFP Personality)\n    Poetic, kind and altruistic people, always eager to help a good cause.\n\n-   **[Protagonist](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality)**: (ENFJ Personality)\n    Charismatic and inspiring leaders, able to mesmerize their listeners.\n\n-   **[Campaigner](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality)**: (ENFP Personality)\n    Enthusiastic, creative and sociable free spirits, who can always find a reason to smile.\n\n### Sentinels\n\n-   **[Logistician](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality)**: (ISTJ Personality)\n    Practical and fact-minded individuals, whose reliability cannot be doubted.\n\n-   **[Defender](https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality)**: (ISFJ Personality)\n    Very dedicated and warm protectors, always ready to defend their loved ones.\n\n-   **[Executive](https://www.16personalities.com/estj-personality)**: (ESTJ Personality)\n    Excellent administrators, unsurpassed at managing things – or people.\n\n-   **[Consul](https://www.16personalities.com/esfj-personality)**: (ESFJ Personality)\n    Extraordinarily caring, social and popular people, always eager to help.\n\n### Explorers\n\n-   **[Virtuoso](https://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality)**: (ISTP Personality)\n    Bold and practical experimenters, masters of all kinds of tools.\n\n-   **[Adventurer](https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality)**: (ISFP Personality)\n    Flexible and charming artists, always ready to explore and experience something new.\n\n-   **[Entrepreneur](https://www.16personalities.com/estp-personality)**: (ESTP Personality)\n    Smart, energetic and very perceptive people, who truly enjoy living on the edge.\n\n-   **[Entertainer](https://www.16personalities.com/esfp-personality)**: (ESFP Personality)\n    Spontaneous, energetic and enthusiastic people – life is never boring around them.\n\n_Labels and descriptions taken from\n[16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com)._\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nAs I have been experiencing Imposter Syndrome it has been difficult to\ninternalize my accomplishments, acknowledge my strengths and weaknesses and\nunderstand why I act the way I do in certain situations.\n\nHaving done both personality tests I am one step closer to understanding myself\nmore. I believe that discovering myself is a life-long journey but this\nstepping stone is a true eye-opener and very useful for self improvement.\n\nThere are certain personality traits that I have that highly affect my\nexperiences of Imposter Syndrome and being conscious about it I can make more\nrational and deliberate decisions when I put my mind to it.\n\nI believe that if you are able to understand why you do things the way you do,\nyou can deliberately improve your behavior especially in pressured situations.\nIt can improve your productivity, the way you communicate with other personality\ntypes, team dynamics and leadership qualities. Amongst other things.\n\nTaking the test alone won't yield much results. It just highlights possible\ntriggers and can make you more aware. It is a good guidance report to get you\non the path to self-awareness. Daily introspection is still important and\njournaling could aid as improvement documentation.\n",

It can improve your life\nby **transforming the way you see and express yourself**\n<sup id=\"footnote-2\">[2](#footnote-2-ref)</sup>.\n\nThis model shows how you will predictably move through different stages\nas you cope with unexpected and significant or major changes\n<sup id=\"footnote-3\">[3](#footnote-3-ref)</sup>.\n\nIt also describes the effects each stage has on your feelings, thinking,\nperformance and physiology. The principles in this model can help you\nimprove how you process change <sup id=\"footnote-2\">[2](#footnote-2-ref)</sup>.\n\n<span class=\"figure\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jurgenappelo/5201852636\">![Graph][satir-change-graph]</a></span>\n<span class=\"figure-caption\">Virginia Satir Change Curve. This illustration is adapted from the book <a href='http://www.management30.com'>Management 3.0</a></span>\n\n> Life is not what it's supposed to be. It's what it is.\n> The way you cope with it is what makes the difference. ~ Virginia Satir\n\n## The Late Status Quo\n\n<span class=\"figure figure-right\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jurgenappelo/5201852636\">![Puzzle pieces][late-status-quo]</a></span>\n\nThis stage describes your ordinary day-to-day. Although your feelings can\nfluctuate you are still in familiar territory like pieces of a puzzle fitting\ntogether. You are used to how things work and flow in this stage.\n\nEmotions may be fluctuating from comfort, contentment, happiness, excitement,\nto discomfort, dissatisfaction, unhappiness and depression or anxiousness.\n\n## The Foreign Element\n\n<span class=\"figure figure-left\">![Bulls eye][foreign-element]</span>\n\nAll of a sudden something needs to change. Your expectations are challenged.\nYour familiarity is now shaken up due to unexpected information, a\nsignificant event, invalidated assumptions or maybe the realization that\nsomething you have been doing your whole life needs to change.\n\n## Chaos\n\n<span class=\"figure figure-right\">![Chaos squiggle][chaos]</span>\n\nNow you are outside your comfort zone in a big unknown mysterious place. You\nare in an unpredictable unfamiliar territory. This can be very scary by\nalso offer some creativity.\n\nSo it may feel unsafe. You may feel strong emotions which may confuse you:\n\n-   Stress\n-   Confusion\n-   Discomfort\n-   Pain\n-   Fear\n-   Excitement\n-   Euphoria\n-   Strong sense of urgency\n\nYou could behave in ways that are unfamiliar to you:\n\n-   Trying to stay in control\n-   Disengaging and retreating to some familiar activity\n-   Focusing on one small part of the problem\n-   Ignoring the chaos happening around you\n-   Scrambling to find information about what is going on\n\nThis stage is vital to the transformation process so acknowledge your feelings\nand build and use support systems. It can be very creative and a lot of ideas\ncan be generated here.\n\n## The Transforming Idea\n\n<span class=\"figure figure-left\">![Light bulb][transforming-idea]</span>\n\nA powerful idea generated in the Chaos stage could lead to the transformation\nprocess which sheds light on the change and helps you understand it more\nand cope with it. This is the AHA! moment.\n\nYou may not know it is a transforming idea so just try it and see what happens.\nIf it's not, try something other AHA!\n\n## Practice and Integration\n\n<span class=\"figure figure-right\">![Gaming console controller][practice]</span>\n\nThe more you practice this new behavior extracted from your transforming idea\nthe more you integrate it into your life. It is a learning phase that allows for\nmistakes so your progress may ebb and flow.\n\nYou have the opportunity to decide what is working and what isn't which makes\nyou more skilled and hopeful as you continuously learn.\n\n## The New Status Quo\n\n<span class=\"figure figure-left\">![Gold star winners ribbon][new-status-quo]</span>\n\nOnce you have fully absorbed the change you become more healthier, calmer and\nalert. You need to continue feeling safe in this space by practicing.\n\nEmery sums it up elegantly by saying that:\n\n-   You feel good about how rapidly you are learning.\n-   You turn your attention toward other important areas of your life, armed with\n    new skills, knowledge and confidence.\n-   Eventually these new skills become second nature.\n-   Your learnings become assumptions and expectations.\n-   With time, the newness fades, and the New Status Quo becomes a Late Status Quo.\n-   And the change cycle begins again.\n\n<span class=\"figure\">![Graph][satir-change-model-cycle]</span>\n<span class=\"figure-caption\">The Satir Change Process Model Cycle</span>\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nThis model can be used for any self-improvement need. Instead of tracking performance,\nyou could be tracking quality of life over time. Our survival rules are deeply\ningrained into us and we can pinpoint them, analyze them and decide if we still\nneed it or not. If we don't need it, we can change it and this is just one model\nof how we can do so through reflection.\n\nWe don't want behaviors that cause:\n\n-   Exhaustion\n-   Misery\n-   Lack of focus and concentration\n-   Lack of self-care\n-   Lack of social interaction\n-   Lack of physical activity\n-   Problems with relationships\n-   Impending burn-out\n\nThere is a lot of material out there describing the model in detail. I just\nwanted to document the idea as a model to help rewire the brain to transform  unhealthy behaviors to more positive behaviors.

And why does some of \n> us learn things more easily than others? \n\nIn the [part 5](/blog/rewire-your-brain-5/), The Satir Change Process Model,\nwe looked at how the model can help transform unhealthy behaviors to more \npositive behaviors by working through the different stages of how we cope \nwith change.\n\nThese stages show how a change can impact us and how we can get to a point \nwhere we can thrive.\n\n* * *\n\nNeuroplasticity<sup id=\"footnote-1\">[1](#footnote-1-ref)</sup> is the \nability of the brain to form and reorganize synaptic connections, especially \nin response to learning or experience or following injury.\n_‘Neuroplasticity offers real hope to everyone from stroke victims to\ndyslexics’_\n\nIf we look at the term plasticity on it's own it means that something can \neasily be shaped or moulded. In biology, it means that organisms can change \nin its environment or different various habitats.\n\nDebbie Hampton defines it as the umbrella term referring to the ability of your \nbrain to reorganize itself, both physically and functionally, throughout your \nlife due to your environment, behavior, thinking, and emotions \n<sup id=\"footnote-2\">[2](#footnote-2-ref)</sup>. \n\nShe further shares her understanding by stating that the adult brain isn't a\nstatic or hard-wired organ. This means that you are not \"stuck\" with the \nbrain that you are born with <sup id=\"footnote-3\">[3](#footnote-3-ref)</sup>.\n\nShe mentions that it helps people recover from:\n\n-   A stroke, injury and birth abnormalities\n-   Improve symptoms of autism\n-   Improve ADD and ADHD\n-   Helps with learning disabilities and other brain defects\n-   Pull you out of depression and addictions\n-   Reverse obsessive-compulsive patterns\n\n> Among other things, neuroplasticity means that emotions such as happiness \n> and compassion can be cultivated in much the same way that a person can \n> learn through repetition to play golf and basketball or master a musical \n> instrument, and that such practice changes the activity and physical aspects \n> of specific brain areas. ~ Andrew Weil, Spontaneous Healing\n\nShe has discovered the powers of it first-hand by performing her own home-grown,\nexperience-dependent neuroplasticity-based exercises for years to recover from\nher trauma. She also incorporated extensive practices to encourage neuroplastic \nchange:\n\n-   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) <sup id=\"footnote-4\">[4](#footnote-4-ref)</sup>\n-   Meditation <sup id=\"footnote-5\">[5](#footnote-5-ref)</sup>\n-   Mindfulness <sup id=\"footnote-6\">[6](#footnote-6-ref)</sup>\n\n## Fundamentals\n\nThis list is merely a paraphrased summary of Debbie Hampton's list as I am new \nto this concept. For a more elaborate scientific list check out her article\n**Ten Fundamentals Of Rewiring Your Brain** \n<sup id=\"footnote-2\">[2](#footnote-2-ref)</sup>.\n\n1.  **Be in the right frame of mind to make a change.**\n\n    Your mood affects the brain release of neurochemicals. If you are in the \n    right frame of mind then you would probably be actively engaged in what \n    you are doing.\n\n2.  **Focus intensely**\n\n    By actively being engaged in what you are trying to master, you need to \n    focus intensely on what you are doing to help you experience a greater \n    change.\n\n3.  **Practice.**\n\n    The more you practice this change, moment by moment, in time, the more you\n    strengthen the connections of your neurons.\n\n4.  **Learning-driven changes.**\n\n    Cell-to-cell cooperation is crucial for increased reliability. Learning-\n    driven changes increases this cooperation.\n\n    Merzenich says that the more powerfully coordinated your nerve cells are, \n    the more powerful and more reliable their behavioral productions.\n\n5.  **Create a conscious flow of behavior.**\n\n    The brain strengthens its connections between teams of neurons\n    representing separate moments of successive things that reliably occur\n    in serial time.\n\n    This allows your brain to predict what happens next and have a continuous \n    “associative flow” instead of a series of separate, stagnating events.\n\n6.  **Initial changes are temporary.**\n\n    Your brain experiences that change and decides if it must be permanent but \n    it only does this if the experience is fascinating or novel enough.\n\n7.  **Mentally rehearse your change.**\n\n    The brain is changed by internal mental rehearsal in the same ways and \n    involving precisely the same processes that control changes achieved through \n    interactions with the external world.\n\n    According to Merzenich, “You don’t have to move an inch to drive positive \n    plastic change in your brain. Your internal representations of things \n    recalled from memory work just fine for progressive brain plasticity-based \n    learning.”\n\n8.  **Memory guides and controls most learning.**\n\n    As you learn a new skill, your brain takes note of and remembers the good \n    attempts, while discarding the not-so-good tries. Then, it recalls the last \n    good pass, makes incremental adjustments, and progressively improves.\n\n9.  **Take time to learn.**\n\n    Every movement of learning provides a moment of opportunity for the brain to \n    stabilize – and reduce the disruptive power of – potentially interfering \n    backgrounds or “noise.”\n\n    Each time your brain strengthens a connection to advance your mastery of a \n    skill, it also weakens other connections of neurons that weren’t used at \n    that precise moment. \n\n    This negative plastic brain change erases some of the \n    irrelevant or interfering activity in the brain.\n\n10. **It can be healthy and unhealthy.**\n\n    Brain plasticity is a two-way street; it is just as easy to generate \n    negative changes as it is positive ones.\n\n    You have a “use it or lose it” brain. It’s almost as easy to drive changes \n    that impair memory and physical and mental abilities as it is to improve \n    these things. \n\n    Merzenich says that older people are absolute masters at \n    encouraging plastic brain change in the wrong direction.\n\n> Pushing our self past our boundaries of limitation and extreme, sometimes to \n> something that knocks off our comfort zone, it creates new neuro pathways \n> with our brain, we become smarter, wiser, more clarity, our life becomes \n> more fulfilling. Only because we have a totally new experience. We get a \n> new brain with that. Neuroplasticity ~ Angie karan\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nHere we can see how the chemicals of the brain can change. Changes can be short-term \n(chemical), medium term (structural) and long term (functional) \n<sup id=\"footnote-7\">[7](#footnote-7-ref)</sup> \nand the effects \ncan be introduced in many ways to make these changes.\n\nI specifically focused on Debbie Hampton's research and knowledge on this topic\nas this topic is exceptionally broad and offers a variety of techniques to rewire \none's brain.\n\n## References\n\n1.  <a id=\"footnote-1-ref\"></a>[Neuroplasticity](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/neuroplasticity), English Oxford Dictionaries\n\n2.  <a id=\"footnote-2-ref\"></a>[Ten Fundamentals Of Rewiring Your Brain](https://www.thebestbrainpossible.com/the-10-fundamentals-of-rewiring-your-brain/), \n    The Best Brain Possible, Debbie Hampton, October 4, 2015\n\n3.  <a id=\"footnote-3-ref\"></a>[You’re Not Stuck With The Brain You Were Born With](https://www.thebestbrainpossible.com/youre-not-stuck-with-the-brain-you-were-born-with-2/), \n    The Best Brain Possible, Debbie Hampton, September 14, 2014\n\n4.  <a id=\"footnote-4-ref\"></a>[Can We Talk?](https://www.thebestbrainpossible.com/can-we-talk/), The Best Brain Possible,\n    The Best Brain Possible, Debbie Hampton, September 8, 2014.

Doubting Yourself\n\nSure, we all doubt ourselves occasionally​ but the red flag is when it's\nso bad ​that we can't function properly.​\n\nIf you have Imposter Syndrome, ​you've probably convinced yourself ​that you are\nnot good enough.​\n\nI remember working on a massive project recently and ​it was technically complex\nwith a lot of people involved.​\n\nWe had a deadline that we couldn't miss because ​many of our products would simply\nstop working. ​\n\nThis made a lot of people tense and stressed.​\n\n#### Self-Limiting Beliefs\n\nNow, it's relatively easy to write code ​and get it into production​ but it is\nway more challenging ​getting a bunch of people to talk to each other and ​make\nthe right things happen at the right time.​\n\nWith so many people, it's hard to stay on the same page.​ There was a lot of\nconfusion and contradiction​ probably because of miscommunication and\nmisunderstandings.​\n\nI got lost and started doubting myself more and more.​\n\n-   I felt like I didn't know what I was doing,\n-   I second-guessed my code & decisions,​\n-   I believed everyone around me was smarter than me, and\n-   I lost confidence in my skills as a developer.​\n\nI did eventually convince myself ​that I just wasn't good enough ​and that\nI should quit - which I didn't do.\n\n#### Words Define Your Reality\n\nAfter a lot of reflection,​ I came to realize that I have a voice inside my head,​\nand that voice can be really mean.​ It constantly puts me down and I believe it.​\n\nWho remembers Marvin the robot from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?​\nI mean, what a depressed character.​\n\nIt's like having him inside my head all the time - ​only less funny.​\n\n**Words define your reality!​**\nYou will believe the words you use to describe who you are. ​\nIf you keep putting yourself down, ​you will feel negative about yourself.​\n\n#### Holds You Back!\n\nIf you don't address this, ​it can hold you back from doing even the most\nsimplest things such as:​\n\n-   **writing code** ​because you are afraid of being criticized and wrong,​\n-   **prevents you from engaging with others** ​because you are afraid of what\n    others may think about your ideas or solutions,​\n-   **kills innovation and creativity** ​because your mindset is so bleak​, and\n-   **holds you back from grabbing amazing opportunities** ​like applying for that\n    position even if you don't check all the boxes.​\n\n### 2. Setting the Bar Too High\n\nIt is good to push yourself so that you can grow but the red flag is when you set\nthe bar so high ​that you burn out or are doomed to fail.​\n\nIn 2014, I was in a team that changed a lot. ​I would fill gaps that I saw​\nbecause I couldn't miss a deadline ​or let the project fail.​\n\nBefore I joined the team, ​I was used to working alone or in small teams at small\ncompanies​ where I had to do a little bit of everything.​\n\nSo, in this team, I instinctively took on the roles of these people​ where I saw\nthe gaps,​ instead of holding them accountable. I was simply unaware that I could\ndo that.\n\n#### Insane Difficulty Level\n\nBefore I knew it, I was Product Owner, Scrum Master, Designer and Developer...\ntaking on all the responsibilities and stress ​that came with each role.​\n\nI worked so hard to keep everything afloat​ that I did eventually burn out.​\n\nTo make matters worse, I was filling these gaps about six months after\nI joined the company,​ while I was still ramping up.​\nThis was the first time I joined a large corporate​ so the ramp up was steep for me. ​\n\nThere are so many people, systems, servers, products ​and the network\nconstraints (think Internet Proxy!). It was just insane!\n\nAnyway, I realize that I keep increasing the difficulty level ​and expect\nmyself to excel,​ not taking into account ​the emotional, mental and physical\nstrain that I put on myself.​\n\n#### Expect More From Others\n\nWhen you set the bar ridiculously high for yourself, ​the problem is that​ you\nalso set it ridiculously high for those around you and then no-one can live\nup to your expectations.\\*\n\n_\\*Adapted from [Chris Lema](https://youtu.be/uKTm3TV9u4M?t=1231) in his exceptional talk at WordCampPhx_\n\n-   If you work long hours, you expect others to do the same,​\n-   If you learn new tech in your spare time, then others must too and​,\n-   Dare someone not do TDD if it is something you strong believe in and expect.​\n\nIt's important to know that people focus on different things in life​ and it is\nunfair for us to impose what we think is important on them.​\n\n#### The Unicorn Job\n\nThe same applies for finding the \"perfect\" job.​ ​\n\nStart-ups look cool right!?​ They look really attractive. ​\nWork here, learn lots, make cool stuff and have fun.​ ​\n\nBigger companies like Google, Netflix, Spotify and Facebook...\nthey look even more attractive because of their benefits​ and the cool products\nthey create.​ ​\n\nThey advertise a culture of learning, innovation and fun​ where staff are well\nlooked after - on their standards.​ ​\n\nWhat they don't always show is the pain.​\nThe problems, flaws and constraints, all those negative things they need to\ndeal with​ which are probably similar to what you are currently experiencing in\nyour job today.​\n\n#### You Are Missing Out\n\nWe are suckers to this marketing business​.\n\nIt can be for your job, your life...​ I mean, look at Facebook.\nIt is simply the highlight reel of\npeople's lives​.\n\nThis marketing around us is done so well that​ even if you work for an\namazing company right now​ you'd want to leave because it doesn't meet the\nexpectations that you have created in your mind.​\n\nYour life, compared to your friends and family on Facebook​ may seem boring,\nbecause all you're seeing is the​ fun, exciting stuff that is shared.​ ​\n\nIn life we are set on finding the \"perfect\" things​ and we search so hard​ that\nwe miss out on what is currently happening​ in our lives right now.​\n\n### 3. Making Things \"Perfect\"\n\nThis is basically about the inner perfectionist.​\n\nNow it's good to focus on consistency, aesthetics and quality​, but a red flag\nis when you can't let go because it's not perfect.​\n\nIf I think back to the creation of my blog, ​I remember how the pursuit for\nperfection​ exhausted me.​\n\nI created it for a [few reasons](/blog/branding-your-identity/):​\n\n-   To give back to the community by sharing my perspective,​\n-   Have a platform to showcase my skills for my career and​,\n-   Tinker with different technologies.​\n\nI wanted something lightweight​ so I chose Jekyll - which absolutely rocks!​\nand I used Grunt for workflow automation​ such as image resizing, linting,\nminification and so forth.​\n\n#### At What Cost?\n\nI created the website from scratch. Multiple times, in fact, where I\n\n-   Redesigned the interface,\n-   Restructured the folder contents,\n-   Reworked the automation, and\n-   Completely customized the Jekyll integration.\n\nI did this all because I wanted everything to be \"perfect\" before launch.\n\nI invested a lot of hours into this website and I became obsessed.\n\nI would come home from a long day at work, go straight to my laptop where I\nwould spend the rest of the night working on it.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\n-   **Deprioritized health**: I neglected my health as I didn't eat well.\n    I skipped meals, didn't exercise or stretch.\n-   **Fatigue**: I didn't get enough downtime and rest.\n-   **Strain on relationships**: I stopped socializing with friends and family\n    because I was too busy.\n-   **Frustration**: I got frustrated because I kept seeing flaws in the work\n    I was doing.\n\n#### Perfect Code\n\nNow, the same happens with our code. Keeping a codebase maintainable is a good\nthing but where do we stop or draw the line?\n\nWe could refactor it for years to be \"perfect\" but that isn't feasible.\n\nThen again, what is perfect code anyway?\n\nHave you ever looked at code and thought \"what the hell is going on here?\" only\nto do a `git blame` where you sink deep into your chair seeing that you were\nthe author?\n\n#### Good Enough\n\nThis is a sign that we are growing. Our knowledge and skills grow with time.\nInstead of pouring hours and hours into perfecting something we should settle\nfor what is good enough right now.\n\nWhen it satisfies the needs of the business and the customer, then it is good\nenough.\n\nDon't confuse this as an excuse to write bad code. You need to give it your best\nshot but doing so with the knowledge, constraints and resources that you have at\nthat point in time, knowing that there is a possibility that you could fail\nbut without harming yourself in the process.\n\n### 4. Too Afraid to Fail\n\nFear is a good thing when it makes you act or put in extra effort to achieve\nsomething. It's a red flag when it paralyzes you.\n\nLast year I learned to start living outside of my comfort zone. I did a lot of\nstuff that I wouldn't have done before because I was scared of what people would\nthink of me or didn't feel confident in myself to try it.\n\nThe scariest thing I signed up for was public speaking.\n\n#### Panic!\n\nThe idea makes my knees weak and my heart race. I get anxious and nauseous. My\nthroat closes and I feel like I can't breathe properly.\n\nNow, I don't have to wait to get onto the stage in front of everyone to feel this\nway. In fact, from the day my talk got accepted until presenting it, I'd been\nstruggling to cope with this.\n\nI was getting panic attacks. Logic couldn't save me. Advice, suggestions or\ntips didn't save me. It was bad.\n\n#### Push Through\n\nIt was something I wanted to achieve so I wanted to push through. I did four\nthings:\n\n-   **Fully commit to it**: I tweeted that I would be talking and booked my travel\n    and accommodation so that it would be considerably harder to back out.\n-   **Breathe**: To deal with the panic attacks I had to learn to breathe deeply.\n    I needed to calm my mind so that I could think clearer to soothe the anxiety\n    and work on my content.\n-   **Prepare**: Even though I was terrified, being unprepared would have made\n    matters worse. I prepared the content and practiced the delivery multiple times.\n-   **Get a support structure**: Without the support structure from amazing people\n    in my life I may have backed out. I got different perspectives, coaching and\n    emotional support which helped to reduce the panic and anxiety.\n\n## Techniques\n\n### Befriend You Imposter\n\nNow that we can identify and name our imposter, we can befriend it by taking\nback control of our minds.\n\nWe can see it as that cautious friend that keeps you and your ego in check, which\ncan be quite humbling. Having that balance keeps you from becoming over-confident\nand arrogant.\n\nHere are some of the techniques that can help you find your balance.\n\n-   **Be honest with yourself**:\n    Juggling all these feelings can be scary and overwhelming.\n    Accept that you are experiencing Imposter Syndrome and know that you can\n    work through it.\n\n-   **You are in control**:\n    You may feel like a victim but your mind is creating this bleak reality. You\n    can actually control it even if it doesn't feel like it.\n\n-   **Calm your mind**:\n    If your mind is too busy then you can't focus or be in control. Realize that\n    you are not your thoughts and feelings. They come and go, so you don't need\n    to be consumed by them.\n\n    Breathing, meditation and mindfulness practices can help you calm your mind.\n\n-   **Be kind to yourself**:\n    Being your own worst enemy isn't going to get you anywhere. Accept yourself\n    for who you are and be conscious of the words you use to talk about yourself.\n\n    You are the most important person in your life. Look after yourself mentally,\n    physically and emotionally.\n\n-   **Reflect**:\n    There are always things you can do to improve on. Reflect by asking yourself\n    what is going well, what isn't going so well and how can I improve?\n\n-   **Talk about it**:\n    So many people are affected by this but few talk about it or even realize it.\n    Know that you are not alone. You don't have to suffer in silence.\n\n    Get a different perspective on your performance and behavior by talking to\n    people around you. You can also give back by sharing your experiences and\n    perspective.\n\n-   **Get support**:\n    Find a mentor with a similar personality to get guidance that will help you\n    in situations where you struggle.\n\n    You could also start or join a meetup group where you have regular discussions\n    about this.\n\n-   **Take it day by day**:\n    It's a bumpy road. Some days are good, others not so much.\n\n    I have to put in a lot of effort and sometimes I feel like I'm right back at\n    the beginning of this road.\n\n    I just take it day by day and try not to be hard on myself. I am only human.\n\n-   **Get outside your comfort zone**:\n    It's easy to stagnate in this place of comfort. If you want to grow then do\n    something that scares you, something you haven't done before or learn a new\n    skill.\n\nAnd when all else fails, do what Barney Stinson says **\"When I'm sad I stop being\nsad and be awesome instead.\"**\n\nWhy go through life missing out on opportunities, constantly putting yourself\ndown and being scared of how other people see you?\n\nYou are not immortal, so take your life back!\n\n* * *\n\n**The Imposter Test**\n\n[The Clance IP Test](http://paulineroseclance.com/pdf/IPscoringtest.pdf) was\ndeveloped by clinical psychologist Pauline Clance to help individuals determine\nwhether or not they have Imposter Syndrome characteristics, and if so, to what\nextent they are suffering.\n\nAfter taking the Imposter Test, add together the numbers of the responses to\neach statement. If the total score is 40 or less, the respondent has few\nImposter characteristics; if the score is between 41 and 60, the respondent has\nmoderate IP experiences; a score between 61 and 80 means the respondent\nfrequently has Imposter feelings; and a score higher than 80 means the\nrespondent often has intense IP experiences. The higher the score, the more\nfrequently and seriously the Imposter Phenomenon interferes in a person’s life.\n\n* * *\n\n## Resources\n\n-   [Download the slides (PDF)](/slides/rubyfuza-2017-the-imposter-within.pdf)\n-   [YouTube Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkgAc0DY4s8)\n-   [Twitter Moments](https://twitter.com/i/moments/830378337516322816)\n-   [Beat Imposter Syndrome](http://beatImpostersyndrome.net/)\n-   [Leaving Comfort Behind](http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-202-clarice-bouwer-leaving-comfort-behind) - Episode 202 on the Developer On Fire podcast\n-   [I'm a phony.

This\ntechnique helps us rewire the brain to change our behavior.\n\nIn Part 3 we will focus on Distress Tolerance. This skill also helps to improve\nour behavior by introducing skills that help us cope under distress.\n\nIt is useful in a crisis or bad situation where emotions are overwhelming.\nThe skills help us cope and survive the situation so that we can tolerate both\nthe physical and emotional pain that we experience.\n\nDistress Tolerance is a module in [Dialectical Behavior Therapy](http://behavioraltech.org/resources/whatisdbt.cfm)\n(DBT).\n\nAccording to [behavioraltech.org](http://behavioraltech.org), DBT is a cognitive behavioral treatment that\nwas originally developed to treat chronically suicidal individuals diagnosed with\nborderline personality disorder (BPD) and it is now recognized as the\ngold standard psychological treatment for this population.\n\nThey go on to say that research says it is effective in treating other disorders such as\nsubstance dependence, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\nand eating disorders.\n\n> I believe that Distress Tolerance offers essential life skills. It empowers\n> you to cope with simple or complex day-to-day challenges. It is a great tool\n> to use on your self improvement journey.\n\nThese skills don't teach us to change the situation. We just accept that it\nis the way it is because of a lot of shit that happened leading to that moment.\nWe learn to tolerate the overwhelming emotions and minimize the suffering.\n\nThrough deliberate practice, I believe that the more this skill is exercised, the\nmore automatic it becomes, **thus our brains are rewired to minimize suffering**.\n\n* * *\n\nWe don't know when we are going to hurt and sometimes it's outside our control.\nLet's see how we can cope with the bullshit that comes our way.\n\nFirstly, from my perspective,\nif you ever played Diablo 3, you will be familiar with the Inferno level—\nthe hardest difficulty level in the game.\nWell, I experience my pain on Inferno level.\n\nMy physical and emotional pain is so **overwhelmingly painful** that\nI obviously can't think straight in that mindset. This leads to the inability to\ncreate solutions to the challenges I am facing. It also leads to awkward\nreactions and regrettable behavior.\n\n## Self-destructive coping mechanisms\n\nSelf-destructive coping mechanisms is not how we should deal with the bullshit\nthat comes our way, but in many times it's the only way we know how to cope.\n\nLet's make up a scenario. Alex gets into a fight at work about something miniscule.\nThis fight leaves him drained and desperately wanting to binge on some\ncrisp beers in his fridge at home.\n\nHe drives home thinking about how he could have changed Ryan's perspective or how\nhe could have handled the situation better. Alex is still angry and traffic is a\nbitch. He curses, swears and flips off other drivers while he critically dwells\non the situation.\n\nHe starts to fear that it may impact his position at work and gets\nanxious for the next day. Finally he gets home and hits the wall as hard as\nhe can with his fist. The wall doesn't crack under his force and he starts\ndrinking beer after beer alone at home not wanting to see other people.\n\nNow he has a semi-broken fist and a monstrous hangover to start a new day.\n\n* * *\n\nStrategies such as dwelling on the past, being anxious about the future,\nisolation from others, taking frustrations out on others, substance abuse,\nself-harm, and so on, are all self-destructive coping mechanisms.\n\nThese mechanisms only deepens the pain both physically and emotionally\nand come at a negative cost.\n\n<span class=\"figure figure-left\">![Negative reinforcing loop (thinking about the past)][negative-reinforcing-loop-past]</span>\n\nThink about it. If you are obsessively dwelling on the past, you are missing out\non what is happening right now. You miss out on all the good things happening\nat this moment. You stay stuck and depressed on past things that you cannot change\nand later regret that you got stuck and depressed and missed out on now.\n\nIt's a negative reinforcing loop.\n\nWhat are your self-destructive coping mechanisms? Think about the cost it has\non your relationships, career, health, wealth and your mindset. Become aware of the\ndangers that unfold when leveraging these self-destructive coping mechanisms.\n\nWe need to replace these bad coping mechanisms with something more healthy.\n\n## Radical acceptance\n\nWe can cope with the bullshit that comes our way by changing our attitude.\nInstead of reacting by getting angry, upset, blaming someone or something, or\ncriticizing yourself for causing pain; you can radically accept the situation.\n\nThat means that:\n\n-   You should **acknowledge the situation** you currently find yourself in.\n-   **Don't judge** the event **or criticize** yourself.\n-   **Recognize** that **the situation exists because of** a lot of shit that happened\n    in **the past** leading up to this moment.\n\nYou **cannot change what is outside of your control**. You can control your\nactions, behavior and attitude.\n\n<span class=\"figure figure-right\">![Negative reinforcing loop (victim role)][negative-reinforcing-loop-victim]</span>\n\nBlaming others or the situation and getting angry doesn't alleviate your pain\nand suffering. It just makes it worse because you can't change it. Another\nnegative reinforcing loop exists here. **_Poor solutions come from being\nblinded by rage_**.\n\nIt doesn't mean that you agree with or condone the bad behavior\nof others or the circumstances, it just stops you from trying to change\nwhat you cannot. You minimize the suffering by refocusing your attention\non what you can do now.\n\nThis can help you think more clearly and figure out a better way to cope.\n\nTell yourself phrases like:\n\n-   This is the way it has to be\n-   It's no use fighting the past\n-   The present is the only moment I have control over\n-   This moment is exactly as it should be, given what’s happened before\n\n## Distraction plan\n\n<span class=\"figure figure-left\">![Keep calm poster][keep-calm-distract]</span>\n\nYou can temporarily distract yourself from the overwhelming pain. Focus\non something that can help you calm down. It's like those silly calm down posters,\nlike the one on the left.\n\nDistraction skills can help you formulate a plan to deflect the pain and\ndiscomfort you feel at that time. Choose activities that work for you so that\nyou can use them when you find yourself in dire straits.\n\nThe idea is not to avoid the challenges you\nare facing, rather to get your mind to a place of clarity and focus. This will\nhelp you find better solutions to the challenges and behave or react in a\nhealthier way.\n\n-   **Distract yourself from self-destructive behaviors**\n\n    Instead of hurting yourself try techniques like squeezing an ice-cube, screaming\n    into a pillow or while you're alone in your car, snap a rubber band on your wrist, write\n    hate letters to people and throw them away, throw socks or paper balls as hard\n    as you can on a wall or cry.\n\n    Try any technique that you can think of, or Google,\n    that will alleviate the pain without you physically harming yourself.\n\n-   **Distract yourself with pleasurable activities**\n\n    Do something that makes you feel good such as exercise, a walk in the park,\n    stretch your muscles, play video games, go to the movies, make your favorite\n    food, watch something silly on YouTube, get a massage, sit in the garden,\n    read a good book, do something nice that you have been putting off, take a\n    bubble bath.\n\n    Whatever your flavor of pleasurable things to do, try doing one\n    to take your mind off things allowing yourself time to cool down.\n\n-   **Distract yourself by paying attention to someone else**\n\n    Do something for someone else like seeing if a friend or family member needs help\n    with something or volunteer somewhere.\n\n    Take the attention off yourself. You can be _creepy_ and go to a public place\n    like a mall and watch what other people are doing, what they're wearing, how they\n    are walking and what they are saying.\n\n    Think about someone you care about. If you had to talk to them now, what would\n    they say to you?\n\n-   **Distract your thoughts**\n\n    We can't control what thoughts our brains conjure up for us. The more attention\n    we give it, the more it stays. The harder we try to forget about it, the same\n    applies.\n\n    When we get stuck in a negative thought pattern it keeps us [stuck](https://singjupost.com/the-secret-of-becoming-mentally-strong-by-amy-morin-full-transcript/).\n    We want to get out of the unhealthy beliefs of ourselves, others and the world.\n\n    To distract our thoughts we can try think of other memories or creative images.\n    Try picture pleasant events from the past or imagine a calming fantasy place.\n\n    Do this in detail. What detailed imagery do you see? What does it look like?\n    What colors do you see? Who is with you? What do they look like? What smells are there?\n    What sensations are you experiencing?\n\n-   **Distract yourself by leaving**\n\n    Sometimes we forget that we can exit a situation.\n\n    If it is a heated conversation with a colleague or loved one and you aren't coping,\n    tell the person that you need to step out. Give them an idea when you will\n    be back so that you manage their expectations.\n\n    If you are in a meeting and your emotions are flaring up, your contribution\n    won't be healthy. Politely excuse yourself from the meeting and return when\n    you have calmed down.\n\n    If you are working on code that isn't compiling or working the way you intended\n    and find yourself getting frustrated, get up and clear your mind. It's also\n    wise to get two or more developers to work with you so that you can conquer\n    the problem as a collective.\n\n    If you are in a place waiting for service which is taking too long, instead\n    of getting angry, simply leave. You can always come back later if you so choose.\n\n-   **Distract yourself with tasks and chores**\n\n    Take the time to complete chores or things on your TODO list like doing the\n    dishes, cleaning your room, redecorating, cleaning out your closet, organizing\n    or calling someone you haven't called in a while.\n\n-   **Distract yourself by counting**\n\n    This is a simple skill that can keep your mind busy. You can count your\n    breaths by breathing deeply; count cars, people, sounds, sensations, clouds;\n    or count or subtract in increments of a number greater than 1.\n\n## Relaxation plan\n\n<span class=\"figure figure-right\">![Keep calm poster][keep-calm-relax]</span>\n\nWhen you are relaxed, your body feels good. Your heart beats slowly and your\nblood pressure is reduced.\n\nYou are no longer in survival mode or in a state of emergency panicking about facing\nor fleeing the situation.\n\nWhen you are relaxed, your brain is in a healthier state to cope with the\nchallenges that you face.\n\nThe activities below are indented to relax and soothe you. Find what\nworks for you with your senses: smell, sight, hearing, taste and touch; it needs\nto introduce peace and serenity in that moment.\n\nThe activities you choose will formulate your relaxation plan that you can\nrefer to when you find yourself in a pickle. It's wise to formulate two: one\nfor at home and one outside of home.\n\n-   **Smell**\n\n    Find smells that trigger good memories or make you feel good.\n\n    You can burn scented candles or incense; use scented oils; perfumes/colognes; go somewhere\n    with pleasing scents; bake; lie down in the park; buy flowers; or hug someone\n    who smells good.\n\n-   **Sight**\n\n    Apparently a large portion of our brain is devoted solely to our sense of\n    sight so what you look at can have powerful effects on you.\n\n    That means that you can soothe yourself by finding images that have that effect on you. You\n    can find them in magazines, go to places, draw or paint your own or use a\n    photograph.\n\n    You can also use cards with meaningful quotes or text on them. Some key rings\n    come in the form of small booklets with inspirational messages in them.\n\n-   **Hearing**\n\n    Listen to music that soothes you, **not music that reinforces how you are\n    currently feeling**. It creates a negative reinforcing loop which sucks you\n    in deeper.\n\n    You can listen to white noise; classical, relaxation or meditative music;\n    [music for developers](https://musicforprogramming.net/);\n    [coffee shop noises](https://coffitivity.com/); go to a place with peaceful sounds\n    like the Botanical Gardens or a day spa; [nature sounds or ambiance](https://www.calmsound.com/).\n\n-   **Taste**\n\n    Get in touch with tastes that ignite pleasant memories or make you feel good.\n    Try not to over-indulge as it may result in regret, guilt and shame.\n\n    Eat your favorite meal or snack; carry your favorite sweets with you; eat\n    ice cream, chocolate, pudding, fruit; or have a soothing hot beverage.\n\n    Taste each bite (or sip) as you chew (or sip) slowly to enjoy it to its fullest.\n\n-   **Touch**\n\n    We touch a lot of things each day. As our largest organ is our skin we can\n    use this to our advantage when we need to soothe ourselves.\n\n    Carry something you enjoy the touch of like something soft, fluffy or velvety;\n    enjoy a hot or cold shower where the water trickles on your skin;\n    have a warm bubble bath with scented oils, candles and dimmed lights where you\n    enjoy the bubbles popping gently on your skin; get a massage and enjoy the\n    sensation that activate and relax your muscles; or simply wear clothes that\n    you feel comfortable in.\n\n## My final thoughts\n\nThrough Radical Acceptance, Distraction Plans and Relaxation Plans we are\none step closer to properly coping. DBT offers other modules that cover\ncoping mechanisms such as emotion regulation skills, mindfulness skills, and\ninterpersonal effectiveness skills.\n\nIdentify negative coping mechanisms and avoid self-destructive behaviors so\nthat you break the negative reinforcing loop.\n\nAccept that you can't change the past - radically accept the situation for what it is and come to\nterms with the fact that you can't change what has happened leading up to the\nsituation. You can only control how you react in the circumstances.\n\n**Distract. Relax. Cope.**\n\n-   Distract yourself temporarily from the overwhelming emotional pain.\n-   Relax and soothe yourself so that you are in a better frame of mind.\n-   Cope with the emotion to influence healthy behavior or reaction.\n\nThe more these steps are followed the more I believe our brains will be rewired\nto better deal with painful situations thus lowering the amount of suffering\nthat we typically endure.\n\n* * *\n\n**Credit**: This post is a summary of the Distress Tolerance chapter in The Dialectical\nBehavior Skills Workbook listed in the references below.\n\nYou can buy it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Behavior-Therapy-Skills-Workbook/dp/1572245131)\nand [Google Books](https://books.google.co.za/books/about/The_Dialectical_Behavior_Therapy_Skills.html?id=pan4976pG6sC&redir_esc=y).\n\n* * *\n\n## References\n\n-   [DBT](http://behavioraltech.org/resources/whatisdbt.cfm),\n    What is DBT?, The Linehan Institute, Behavioral Tech Research\n\n-   [Behavioral Tech](http://behavioraltech.org),\n    The Linehan Institute, Behavioral Tech Research\n\n-   [The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook](https://myjourneythroughmadness.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/dbt.pdf),\n    Practical DBT exercises for learning Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness,\n    Emotion Regulation and Distress Tolerance by Matthew McKay, PH.D, Jeffrey C.
