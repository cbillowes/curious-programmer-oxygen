I once joined a team that had pressure from all angles.\nFixed deadlines, unexpected and sometimes last minute scope changes,\nresponsible for numerous front-end websites integrating into a highly sensitive\nservice that we had to maintain and was audited regularly.\nMistakes in the entire flow could cost production companies millions and\npeople their jobs.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem with this team was the high staff turnover. Within a few\nmonths of joining, developers started leaving; one month after the other. When new\npeople joined the team, they were completely new to the company which made\nramp up time a nightmare.</p>\n<p>It wasn't just the developers who left. People from all roles either left or\nwere rotated to other teams. Everyone was looking to me for answers to\nquestions I couldn't give. I struggled to keep up with all the changes as well\nas ramping up.</p>\n<p>This was hell for me. I thought I caused people to leave. It turned out that\nthe team always had a bad reputation for change but knowing that didn't help.\nI needed a survival guide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"social-change-is-inevitable\"><a href=\"#social-change-is-inevitable\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Social change is inevitable</h2>\n<p>People come and go.
