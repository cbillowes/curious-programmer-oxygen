This skill also helps to improve\nour behavior by introducing skills that help us cope under distress.</p>\n<p>It is useful in a crisis or bad situation where emotions are overwhelming.\nThe skills help us cope and survive the situation so that we can tolerate both\nthe physical and emotional pain that we experience.</p>\n<p>Distress Tolerance is a module in <a href=\"http://behavioraltech.org/resources/whatisdbt.cfm\">Dialectical Behavior Therapy</a>\n(DBT).</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://behavioraltech.org\">behavioraltech.org</a>, DBT is a cognitive behavioral treatment that\nwas originally developed to treat chronically suicidal individuals diagnosed with\nborderline personality disorder (BPD) and it is now recognized as the\ngold standard psychological treatment for this population.</p>\n<p>They go on to say that research says it is effective in treating other disorders such as\nsubstance dependence, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\nand eating disorders.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe that Distress Tolerance offers essential life skills. It empowers\nyou to cope with simple or complex day-to-day challenges. It is a great tool\nto use on your self improvement journey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These skills don't teach us to change the situation. We just accept that it\nis the way it is because of a lot of shit that happened leading to that moment.\nWe learn to tolerate the overwhelming emotions and minimize the suffering.</p>\n<p>Through deliberate practice, I believe that the more this skill is exercised, the\nmore automatic it becomes, <strong>thus our brains are rewired to minimize suffering</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We don't know when we are going to hurt and sometimes it's outside our control.\nLet's see how we can cope with the bullshit that comes our way.</p>\n<p>Firstly, from my perspective,\nif you ever played Diablo 3, you will be familiar with the Inferno level—\nthe hardest difficulty level in the game.\nWell, I experience my pain on Inferno level.</p>\n<p>My physical and emotional pain is so <strong>overwhelmingly painful</strong> that\nI obviously can't think straight in that mindset.

The wall doesn't crack under his force and he starts\ndrinking beer after beer alone at home not wanting to see other people.</p>\n<p>Now he has a semi-broken fist and a monstrous hangover to start a new day.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Strategies such as dwelling on the past, being anxious about the future,\nisolation from others, taking frustrations out on others, substance abuse,\nself-harm, and so on, are all self-destructive coping mechanisms.</p>\n<p>These mechanisms only deepens the pain both physically and emotionally\nand come at a negative cost.</p>\n<p><span class=\"figure figure-left\"><img src=\"/images/rewire-your-brain-3/negative-reinforcing-loop-past.jpg\" alt=\"Negative reinforcing loop (thinking about the past)\" title=\"I think about the past ↔ I regret thinking about the past\"></span></p>\n<p>Think about it.
