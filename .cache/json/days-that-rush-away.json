Emails and instant messages were streaming in. There was\nlittle time to breathe.</p>\n<p>Have I fallen victim to \"<a href=\"http://smartblogs.com/leadership/2014/05/19/the-rush-syndrome-how-it-affects-your-health-and-your-job/\">rush hour syndrome</a>\"?</p>\n<p>When days get filled to the brim with noise and tasks that cannot be completed,\nhow can we not feel exhausted and unaccomplished? Surely this can't be healthy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It's affected my memory</strong>: And not in a good way. My memory gets worse\nwhen I'm doing too many things at once. Stand-ups are challenging as I struggle\nto recall the mixture of interlaced tasks that I juggled the day before.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quality suffers</strong>: If I can't focus on something and do that well, the\nquality will take a knock. Constant context-switching and multi-tasking\nare a real threat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expectations aren't met</strong>: If I am too busy I struggle to get round to\n<a href=\"/blog/manage-expectations\">managing expectations</a>. If business is expecting\nsomething but there is something else keeping me busy, they need to be aware of\nit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>TODOs spiraling out of control</strong>: Production bugs, changes, queries, issues,\nimprovements, suggestions... the list just grows. It feels like a mountain\ngrowing on my back.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-went-wrong\"><a href=\"#what-went-wrong\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What went wrong?</h2>\n<p>Some days I am very good at tackling things.

Sometimes I forget this.</p>\n<p>If I have an impediment, I usually sort it out myself. This eats into the time\nfor the work that I have committed to completing.
