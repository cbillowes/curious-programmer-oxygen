In reality, how often do they get attended to?</p>\n<p>Looking at the software stack we can see how some decisions and changes that\nbuild over time can cause horrors behind the scenes, all the way from graphics to the\nentire system architecture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Graphics</strong>. Think Photoshop. How many revisions of that file exist? How many\nlayers are there? How many layers are actually named?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Websites</strong>. Think about how many lines appear in each script or stylesheet?\nHow well formatted is the HTML? Are there tables defining the layout?\nLet's not get started on the optimization of images.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Applications &#x26; Services</strong>. Where is the business logic? What does the mapping\nor Anti-Corruption Layer look like? What does the configuration file look\nlike? Where are the passwords stored? What does the documentation look like?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>System architecture</strong>. Do you know what servers and services are being used\nand by whom? Are they routed correctly? Can you easily detect if there is a\nproblem with the load balancing? How do you know if one of the nodes are not\nresponding correctly? Perhaps draw a system diagram of an enterprise system\njust to shock yourself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Organization</strong>. <em>(Heck, let's throw in the business too)</em> What does the\ncompany structure of an enterprise organization look like? Draw another\ndiagram just to confuse yourself. How often does it change?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Behind anything that looks appealing is something dark and sinister looming and\nwaiting to jump out at you and scream \"BOO!\"</p>\n<p>{% include posts/image-caption.html\nurl=\"/img/posts/the-horror-behind-design/technical-debt.jpg\"\ndescription=\"There's a big difference between what the customer sees and what the developer sees.\"\nimage_source=\"Source of image unknown\"\n%}</p>\n<p>We are in the real world where things change rapidly.
