You're\nfamiliar with the surroundings, it has few surprises and everything just makes\nsense.</p>\n<p>I love it but I am never in it long enough to sit back and put my feet up\nwith a bowl of popcorn.</p>\n<p>I keep pushing my limits both personally and professionally. At times I may\n<strong>strongly dislike</strong> what I am doing but after the fact I think to myself \"WOW,\nI just did that!\" It's very rewarding.</p>\n<p>As a developer I can relate to how awkward networking and socializing can be. This\nis even harder when you lack self-confidence. Here are the top three things\nI've done that have helped me build some social confidence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"start-conversations\"><a href=\"#start-conversations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Start conversations</h2>\n<p>When I experienced issues with whatever technology or process, I'd strike up a\nconversation with someone higher up than me. I'd ask questions and try\nbrainstorm with them.</p>\n<p>In the beginning I was so freaked out by simply talking to them that I'd instantly\nblush. So hard in fact that I'd feel my face burn. I ended up being so self-conscious that\nI couldn't hear what they had to say. It was worse when I didn't know\nthe person at all.</p>\n<p>Blogging and tweeting was scary for me too but it also helps start conversations.\nYou put an idea out there and if you're lucky, people start engaging which\ncan either validate your idea or expose you to a new mindset.</p>\n<p>By persisting through the fear, I've built some confidence and learned a lot of\ncool insights from others. I've also been able to engage with some influential\nsoftware developers - something the old me would never have done.\nThe more you do it, the less scary it becomes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attend-events-with-friends\"><a href=\"#attend-events-with-friends\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Attend events with friends</h2>\n<p>I feel more comfortable to sit back and absorb information without engaging\nwith <em>strangers</em> at an event. I'm shy and self-conscious. But now, I act a bit\ndifferently.</p>\n<p>I must admit that it's easier for me to strike up a conversation with someone\nI don't know when I'm with someone I do know. The more the merrier.</p>\n<p>I'd go to meetups or events with my husband (also a developer) or other dev\nbuddies and somehow feel <em>stronger</em>. This makes it easier for me to initiate\nconversations with the speaker or other developers at the event.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: The more you attend community events, the more familiar the people\naround you become.</p>\n<h2 id=\"talk-to-strangers\"><a href=\"#talk-to-strangers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Talk to strangers</h2>\n<p>Start a conversation with a stranger. Elevators and queues are the easiest\nplace to start.</p>\n<p>Smiling makes you approachable and immediately uplifts a person's spirits\n(not always, but most times).</p>\n<p>Giving a true compliment is a great conversation starter and also has a\npositive impact on the other person. When in doubt, bring weather into the\nconversation.</p>\n<p>This helps build confidence when talking to people you don't know which helps\nwhen you want to start networking at events or other social gatherings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-final-thoughts\"><a href=\"#my-final-thoughts\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>My final thoughts</h2>\n<p>I don't know how many software developers are self-conscious or lack\nself-confidence but I know many who are socially awkward.</p>\n<p>Randomly talking to people may not be something you want to do but why not\ngive it a try?</p>\n<p>Engaging with people exposes you to different mindsets and thought patterns.\nThis accelerates learning especially if you're new to something or just\nstarting out. It also helps you network and grow your professional\nreputation. With that comes a lot of career opportunity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I think that we grow when we are outside our comfort zone.
